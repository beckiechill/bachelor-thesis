Language difficulties are a major problem in dementia as linguistic skills break down. Current methods do not provide robust tools to capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. Early detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) from spontaneous speech overcomes the limitations of earlier approaches as it is less time consuming, can be done at home, and is relatively inexpensive. In this work, we re-implement the existing NLP methods, which used CNN-LSTM architectures and targeted features from conversational transcripts. Our work sheds light on why the accuracy of these models drops to 72.92% on the ADReSS dataset, whereas, they gave state of the art results on the DementiaBank dataset. Further, we build upon these language input-based recurrent neural networks by devising an end-to-end deep learning-based solution that performs a binary classification of Alzheimer's Dementia from the spontaneous speech of the patients. We utilize the ADReSS dataset for all our implementations and explore the deep learning-based methods of combining acoustic features into a common vector using recurrent units. Our approach of combining acoustic features using the Speech-GRU improves the accuracy by 2% in comparison to acoustic baselines. When further enriched by targeted features, the Speech-GRU performs better than acoustic baselines by 6.25%. We propose a bi-modal approach for AD classification and discuss the merits and opportunities of our approach.</p>","2021-02-05","2025-02-18 20:14:20","2025-02-18 20:14:20","2025-02-18 20:14:20","","","","13","","Front.

This Research Topic addresses this issue by exploring the use of speech characteristics for AD recognition using balanced data and shared tasks, such as those provided by the ADReSS Challenges (Luz et al., 2020(Luz et al., , 2021. These tasks have brought together groups working on this active area of research, providing the community with benchmarks for comparison of speech and language approaches to cognitive assessment. Reflecting the multidisciplinary character of the topic, the articles in this collection span three journals: Frontiers of Aging Neuroscience, Frontiers of Computer Science and Frontiers in Psychology.Most papers in this Reseach Topic target two main tasks: AD classification, for distinguishing individuals with AD from healthy controls, and cognitive test score regression, to infer the patient&#39;s Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score (Folstein et al., 1975). Of the twenty papers published in this collection, 14 used the ADReSS dataset (Luz et al., 2020), by itself or in combination with other data. The ADReSS dataset is a curated subset of DementiaBank&#39;s Pitt Corpus, matched for age and gender so as to minimise risk of bias in the prediction tasks. The data consist of audio recordings of picture descriptions elicited from participants using the Cookie Theft picture from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (Becker et al., 1994;Goodglass et al., 2001), transcribed and annotated using the CHAT coding system (MacWhinney, 2021). The papers covered a variety of approaches and models.Antonsson, Lundolm Fors, Eckerstr&#246;m, and Kokkinakis aimed to distinguish progressive cognitive decline from stable cognitive impairment using semantic analysis of a discourse task. Support Vector Machine (SVM) models performed best (AUC=0.93) with both semantic verbal fluency scores and disfluency features from the discourse task. Discourse analysis revealed significantly greater use of unrelated speech in the progressive cognitive decline group compared with the stable group and healthy controls (HC).Clarke, Barrick, and Garrard examined the impact of five different speech tasks (picture description, conversation, overlearned narrative recall, procedural recall, novel narrative retelling) on classification of 50 participants: 25 HC, 13 mild AD, 12 MCI. Linguistic features (n=286) were automatically extracted from each task and used to train SVMs. Classification accuracy varied across tasks (62%-78% for HC vs AD+MCI, 59%-90% for HC vs AD, 50%-78% for HC vs MCI) as did which features were most important to the classification. Balagopalan, Eyre, Robin, Rudzicz and Novikova used linguistic and acoustic features derived from ADReSS speech and transcripts. They tuned a pretrained BERT model (Devlin et al., 2018) and compared its features to clinically-interpretable language features. The BERT model outperformed other features and achieved accuracy of 83.33% for AD classification. A ridget regressor with 25 pre-engineered features obtained root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.56 in MMSE prediction.Chlasta, and Wołk used VGGish, a pretrained a Tensorflow model for audio feature extraction and a custom raw waveform based convolutional neural neural (CNN), DemCNN, to model the acoustic characteristics of AD speech on the ADreSS dataset. DemCNN provided better results than VGGish (Hershey et al., 2017) and achieved an accuracy of 62.5% using only the acoustic information.De Looze, Dehsarvi, Crosby, Vourdanou, Coen, Lawlor and Reilly combined structural MRI, neuropsychological testing and conversational features to explore temporal characteristics of speech in a collaborative referencing task. They investigated associations with cognitive function and volumetry in brain areas known to be affected by MCI and AD. A linear mixed-effect model was built for data of 32 individuals to assess the predictive power of conversational speech features to classify clinical groups. They found that slower speech and slower turn-taking may provide useful markers for early detection of cognitive decline.Guo, Li, Roan, Pakhomov, and Cohen emphasized the importance of large normative datasets in training accurate and reliable machine learning models for dementia detection. They incorporated a new corpus of Cookie Theft picture descriptions (HC=839, NC=115) from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (Herd et al., 2014) to train a BERT model and demonstrated improved performance on the detection task compared with results of the model trained on the ADReSS data alone (82.1% vs 79.8, accuracy, and 92.3% vs 88.3% AUC).Haulcy and Glass investigated the use of i-vectors and x-vectors (Snyder et al., 2018), which are acoustic features originally devised for speaker identification, and linguistic features to tackle AD detection and MMSE prediction. The i-vectors and x-vectors were pre-trained on existing datasets unrelated to AD as well as in-domain data. Several classification and regression models were tested, yielding 85.4% accuracy in AD detection with SVM and Random Forests, and 4.56 RMSE with a gradient boosting regressor. Linguistic and acoustic features were modelled separately. The former yielded better performance. The authors speculate that the poor performance of i-vectors and x-vectors was due to in-and out-of-domain training data mismatch.Jonell, Mo&#235;ll , H&#229;kansson , Henter, Kucherenko , Mikheeva, Hagman, Holleman, Kivipelto, Kjellstr&#246;m, Gustafson and Beskow proposed a multimodal analysis of patient behavior to improve early detection of dementia. Their system captured data from clinical interviews using nine different sensor devices which recorded speech, language, facial gestures, motor signs, gaze, pupil dilation, heart rate variability and thermal emission. This information was gathered from 25 patients with AD and later combined with brain scans, psychological tests, speech therapist assessments and other clinical data. They found that multimodality, in combination with the more established biomarkers, improves clinical discrimination.Laguarta and Subirana present an approach to the identification of different diseases which combines multiple biomarkers (features), including vocal cords, sentiment, lung and respiratory tract, among others. The authors employed transfer learning from other (non-AD) audio datasets to learn these features. The resulting model achieved up to 93% accuracy on the ADReSS dataset. Interestingly, the respiratory tract features, which were previously used in the detection of COVID-19 from a cough dataset, also proved helpful in AD detection.Lindsay, Tr&#246;ger and K&#246;nig investigated spontaneous speech of 78 HC and 76 AD individuals in English and French, proposing a multilingual model. Task-specific, semantic, syntactic and paralinguistic features were analysed. They found that language features, excluding task specific features, represent &quot;generalisable&quot; signs for cognitive language impairment in AD, outperforming all other feature sets. Semantic features were the most generalizable, with paralinguistic features showing no overlap between languages.The work of Mahajan and Baths tested several acoustic and linguistic models, comparing their performance on ADReSS and a larger subset of DementiaBank. They employed a deep learning bimodal model to combine these features. For linguistic models, accuracy was lower on ADReSS than on DementiaBank (73% vs 88%). The authors attribute this to the smaller size of ADReSS and to overfitting in DementiaBank due to repeated samples from the same participant. Although the best linguistic model performed similarly to the bimodal learner, the authors suggest a number of possible improvements.Martinc, Haider, Pollak and Luz presented a multimodal approach to AD detection using ADreSS data. The Active Data Representation method (Haider et al., 2020) was used for fusion of acoustic and textual features at sentence and word level, along with temporal aspects of linguistic features. They achieved an accuracy of 93.75% through late fusion of acoustic, text and temporal models.Meghanani, Anoop, and Ramakrishnan compared two approaches to the challenge tasks based on use of the non-automatic, hand-created transcripts. Both methods relied on the extraction of n-grams of varying lengths (n=2,3,4,5) from the transcripts. The first method employed CNNs with a single convolutional layer in which the kernel size was adapted to the n-gram size. The second method used the fastText model with bigrams and trigrams. The fastText models outperformed the CNN models, achieving 83.3% accuracy for classification and RMSE of 4.87 for prediction of MMSE scores.Millington and Luz approached the data representation problem in the ADReSS dataset by converting its text transcriptions into word co-occurrence graphs and computing several graph structure metrics. They found that AD graphs have lower heterogeneity and centralization, but higher edge density. These metrics were used as input features to standard machine learning classifiers and regressors. A graph embedding metric was tested for comparison. Graph metrics outperformed graph embedding, achieving 66.7% accuracy in classification, and 5.67 RMSE in MMSE regression.Nasreen, Rohanian, Hough and Purver investigated the role of conversational features such as dysfluencies, pauses, overlaps and other interactional elements in AD detection. They used the Carolinas Conversations Collection (Pope and Davis, 2011) to create classification models based on those features. The combination of dysfluency and interactional features resulted in a classification accuracy of 90%. These findings in conversational speech seem to agree with the findings from other papers in this Research Topic, which highlighted the importance of pauses and dysfluency in detecting AD in the ADReSS monologue data.Parvin, Mohammadian, Amani-Shalamzari, Bayati and Tazesh performed a randomised controlled clinical trial to investigate the effects of dual-task training on 26 patients with AD. Patients performed physical, cognitive and mental assessments and had their brain oscillations measured pre-and post-intervention, which consisted of a 12-week visual training program. The trained group showed significant improvements in cognitive function, mood and fitness. This was associated with a significant positive change in brain oscillation.Sadeghian, Schaffer, and Zahorian examined the potential of an almost fully automated system for AD detection. Rather than using DementiaBank, they collected 72 new samples (26 AD, 46 HC) with higher quality audio. ASR was performed on data with pauses removed using voice activity detection. From this, they extracted 236 textual features and then used a genetic algorithm as well as a Multi-Layer Perceptron to identify the 10 most useful features, achieving 94% accuracy in detection. Shah Sawalha, Tasnim, Qi, Stroulia and Greiner used speech samples from the DementiaBank database for binary classification and MMSE regression. Although they developed models that combined acoustic and language-based features, their best performing model for binary classification used language-based features only with a regularized logistic regression, achieving 85.4% accuracy on a hold-out test set. A more reduced set of language features was their best performing model for the regression task, with an RMSE of 5.62.Yuan, Cai, Bian, Ye, and Church presented a method for encoding filled and unfilled pauses in transcripts to fine tune the training of language models using BERT and ERNIE. The accuracy of dementia detection improved to 89.6% (with ERNIE). Compared with controls, the individuals with dementia vocalised filled pause um much less frequently than uh, and their language samples included more pauses.Zhu, Liang, Batsis, and Roth used a transfer learning technique to fine-tuning the last layers of a pretrained model with customized layers for AD detection. The MobileNet and YAMNet network architectures were employed for this. They then used speech and text versions of BERT, individually and in combination for the same task. The text models outperformed the speech models, with the version based on pre-training with the longest input frame achieving 89.58% accuracy. The models which combined audio and speech data generally performed better than the models separately.","2021-10-21","2025-02-18 20:21:08","2025-02-18 20:21:08","2025-02-18 20:21:08","","","","3","","Front.

However, current diagnostic techniques are not designed for frequent mass screening, delaying therapeutic intervention and worsening prognoses. To be able to detect AD at an early stage, ideally at a pre-clinical stage, speech analysis emerges as a simple low-cost non-invasive procedure. Objectives: In this work it is our objective to do a systematic review about speech-based detection and classification of Alzheimer’s Disease with the purpose of identifying the most effective algorithms and best practices. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed from Jan 2015 up to May 2020 using ScienceDirect, PubMed and DBLP. Articles were screened by title, abstract and full text as needed. A manual complementary search among the references of the included papers was also performed. Inclusion criteria and search strategies were defined a priori. Results: We were able: to identify the main resources that can support the development of decision support systems for AD, to list speech features that are correlated with the linguistic and acoustic footprint of the disease, to recognize the data models that can provide robust results and to observe the performance indicators that were reported. Discussion: A computational system with the adequate elements combination, based on the identified best-practices, can point to a whole new diagnostic approach, leading to better insights about AD symptoms and its disease patterns, creating conditions to promote a longer life span as well as an improvement in patient quality of life. The clinically relevant results that were identified can be used to establish a reference system and help to define research guidelines for future developments.","2022-01","2025-02-18 20:22:32","2025-02-18 20:22:32","2025-02-18 20:22:32","27","","1","9","","","Speech- and Language-Based Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/YCEHXE9X/Vigo et al. - 2022 - Speech- and Language-Based Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease A Systematic Review.pdf","","","Alzheimer’s disease (AD); classification; features; machine learning (ML); mild cognitive impairment (MCI); speech","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Picture description tasks are routinely used to monitor language impairment in AD. Due to the high amount of manual resources needed for an in-depth analysis of thereby-produced spontaneous speech, advanced natural language processing (NLP) combined with machine learning (ML) represents a promising opportunity. In this applied research field though, NLP and ML methodology do not necessarily ensure robust clinically actionable insights into cognitive language impairment in AD and additional precautions must be taken to ensure clinical-validity and generalizability of results. In this study, we add generalizability through multilingual feature statistics to computational approaches for the detection of language impairment in AD. We include 154 participants (78 healthy subjects, 76 patients with AD) from two different languages (106 English speaking and 47 French speaking). Each participant completed a picture description task, in addition to a battery of neuropsychological tests. Each response was recorded and manually transcribed. From this, task-specific, semantic, syntactic and paralinguistic features are extracted using NLP resources. Using inferential statistics, we determined language features, excluding task specific features, that are significant in both languages and therefore represent “generalizable” signs for cognitive language impairment in AD. In a second step, we evaluated all features as well as the generalizable ones for English, French and both languages in a binary discrimination ML scenario (AD vs. healthy) using a variety of classifiers. The generalizable language feature set outperforms the all language feature set in English, French and the multilingual scenarios. Semantic features are the most generalizable while paralinguistic features show no overlap between languages. The multilingual model shows an equal distribution of error in both English and French. By leveraging multilingual statistics combined with a theory-driven approach, we identify AD-related language impairment that generalizes beyond a single corpus or language to model language impairment as a clinically-relevant cognitive symptom. We find a primary impairment in semantics in addition to mild syntactic impairment, possibly confounded by additional impaired cognitive functions.</p>","2021-05-19","2025-02-18 20:22:44","2025-02-18 20:22:44","2025-02-18 20:22:44","","","","13","","Front.

Computational analysis of connected speech using Natural Language Processing and machine learning has been found to indicate disease and could be utilized as a rapid, scalable test for early diagnosis. However, there has been a focus on the Cookie Theft picture description task, which has been criticized. Fifty participants were recruited – 25 healthy controls (HC), 25 mild AD or MCI (AD+MCI) – and these completed five connected speech tasks: picture description, a conversational map reading task, recall of an overlearned narrative, procedural recall and narration of a wordless picture book. A high-dimensional set of linguistic features were automatically extracted from each transcript and used to train Support Vector Machines to classify groups. Performance varied, with accuracy for HC vs. AD+MCI classification ranging from 62% using picture book narration to 78% using overlearned narrative features. This study shows that, importantly, the conditions of the speech task have an impact on the discourse produced, which influences accuracy in detection of AD beyond the length of the sample. Further, we report the features important for classification using different tasks, showing that a focus on the Cookie Theft picture description task may narrow the understanding of how early AD pathology impacts speech.</p>","2021-05-31","2025-02-19 08:28:28","2025-02-19 08:28:28","2025-02-19 08:28:28","","","","3","","Front.

Timely diagnosis of dementia could be followed by introducing interventions that may slow down its progression or reduce its burdens. However, the diagnostic process of dementia is often complex and resource intensive. Access to diagnostic services is also an issue in low and middle-income countries. The abundance and easy accessibility of speech and language data have created new possibilities for utilizing Deep Learning (DL) technologies to be part of the dementia diagnostic process. This systematic review included studies published between 2012–2022 that utilized such technologies to aid in diagnosing dementia. We identified 72 studies using the PRISMA 2020 protocol, extracted and analyzed data from these studies and reported the related DL technologies. We found these technologies effectively differentiated between healthy individuals and those with a dementia diagnosis, highlighting their potential in the diagnosis of dementia. This systematic review provides insights into the contributions of DL-based speech and language techniques to support the dementia diagnostic process. It also offers an understanding of the advancements made in this field thus far and highlights some challenges that still need to be addressed.","2023-11-01","2025-02-19 08:29:16","2025-02-19 08:29:16","2025-02-19 08:29:16","115538","","","329","","Psychiatry Research","Speech and language processing with deep learning for dementia diagnosis","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Cognitive impairment; Deep learning; Dementia; PRISMA systematic literature review; Speech and language processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite nationwide efforts for timely diagnosis of patients with ADRD, >50 % of them are not diagnosed and unaware of their disease. To address this challenge, we developed ADscreen, an innovative speech-processing based ADRD screening algorithm for the protective identification of patients with ADRD. ADscreen consists of five major components: (i) noise reduction for reducing background noises from the audio-recorded patient speech, (ii) modeling the patient's ability in phonetic motor planning using acoustic parameters of the patient's voice, (iii) modeling the patient's ability in semantic and syntactic levels of language organization using linguistic parameters of the patient speech, (iv) extracting vocal and semantic psycholinguistic cues from the patient speech, and (v) building and evaluating the screening algorithm. To identify important speech parameters (features) associated with ADRD, we used the Joint Mutual Information Maximization (JMIM), an effective feature selection method for high dimensional, small sample size datasets. Modeling the relationship between speech parameters and the outcome variable (presence/absence of ADRD) was conducted using three different machine learning (ML) architectures with the capability of joining informative acoustic and linguistic with contextual word embedding vectors obtained from the DistilBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We evaluated the performance of the ADscreen on an audio-recorded patients' speech (verbal description) for the Cookie-Theft picture description task, which is publicly available in the dementia databank. The joint fusion of acoustic and linguistic parameters with contextual word embedding vectors of DistilBERT achieved F1-score = 84.64 (standard deviation [std] = ±3.58) and AUC-ROC = 92.53 (std = ±3.34) for training dataset, and F1-score = 89.55 and AUC-ROC = 93.89 for the test dataset. In summary, ADscreen has a strong potential to be integrated with clinical workflow to address the need for an ADRD screening tool so that patients with cognitive impairment can receive appropriate and timely care.","2023-09-01","2025-02-19 08:33:17","2025-02-19 08:33:17","2025-02-19 08:33:17","102624","","","143","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","ADscreen","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/NKVEQCAX/Zolnoori et al. - 2023 - ADscreen A speech processing-based screening system for automatic identification of patients with A.pdf","","","Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Screening algorithm; Speech analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease using speech-based features is gaining growing attention. The aim of this study is to extract linguistic features following a proposed taxonomy of language impairment of AD patients.

Detecting diagnostic biomarkers that are noninvasive and cost-effective is of great value not only for clinical assessments and diagnostics but also for research purposes. Several previous studies have investigated AD diagnosis via the acoustic, lexical, syntactic, and semantic aspects of speech and language. Other studies include approaches from conversation analysis that look at more interactional aspects, showing that disfluencies such as fillers and repairs, and purely nonverbal features such as inter-speaker silence, can be key features of AD conversations. These kinds of features, if useful for diagnosis, may have many advantages: They are simple to extract and relatively language-, topic-, and task-independent. This study aims to quantify the role and contribution of these features of interaction structure in predicting whether a dialogue participant has AD. We used a subset of the Carolinas Conversation Collection dataset of patients with AD at moderate stage within the age range 60–89 and similar-aged non-AD patients with other health conditions. Our feature analysis comprised two sets: <italic>disfluency</italic> features, including indicators such as self-repairs and fillers, and <italic>interactional</italic> features, including overlaps, turn-taking behavior, and distributions of different types of silence both within patient speech and between patient and interviewer speech. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between AD and non-AD groups for several disfluency features (edit terms, verbatim repeats, and substitutions) and interactional features (lapses, gaps, attributable silences, turn switches per minute, standardized phonation time, and turn length). For the classification of AD patient conversations vs. non-AD patient conversations, we achieved 83% accuracy with disfluency features, 83% accuracy with interactional features, and an overall accuracy of 90% when combining both feature sets using support vector machine classifiers. The discriminative power of these features, perhaps combined with more conventional linguistic features, therefore shows potential for integration into noninvasive clinical assessments for AD at advanced stages.</p>","2021-06-18","2025-02-19 08:49:40","2025-02-19 08:49:40","2025-02-19 08:49:40","","","","3","","Front.
