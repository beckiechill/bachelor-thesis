Drawing on empirical implementation in Sri Lanka`s Sinhala-speaking communities, this study presents a methodological framework designed to transform participatory development research in the multilingual context of Sri Lanka`s flood-prone Nilwala River Basin. Moving beyond conventional translation and data collection tools, the proposed framework leverages a multi-agent system architecture to redefine how data collection, analysis, and community engagement are conducted in linguistically and culturally complex research settings. This structured, agent-based approach facilitates participatory research that is both scalable and adaptive, ensuring that community perspectives remain central to research outcomes. Field experiences underscore the immense potential of LLM-based systems in addressing long-standing issues in development research across resource-limited regions, delivering both quantitative efficiencies and qualitative improvements in inclusivity. At a broader methodological level, this research advocates for AI-driven participatory research tools that prioritize ethical considerations, cultural sensitivity, and operational efficiency. It highlights strategic pathways for deploying AI systems to reinforce community agency and equitable knowledge generation, offering insights that could inform broader research agendas across the Global South.","2025-01","2025-03-01 10:28:02","2025-03-01 10:28:02","2025-03-01 10:28:01","108–121","","","","","","Enhancing Participatory Development Research in South Asia through LLM Agents System","","","","","Association for Computational Linguistics","Abu Dhabi","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/P7XX4F4M/Zhao et al. - 2025 - Enhancing Participatory Development Research in South Asia through LLM Agents System An Empirically.pdf","","","","Weerasinghe, Ruvan; Anuradha, Isuri; Sumanathilaka, Deshan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We apply generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) to our dataset and demonstrate the added benefit of using multiview embeddings in two downstream tasks: identifying AD and predicting clinical scores. By including multiview embeddings, we obtain an F1 score of 0.82 in the classification task and a mean absolute error of 3.42 in the regression task.

In an attempt to reconcile the mixed results reported in this context, we present a systematic comparison of 6 hybrid approaches along with standard Machine Learning and DL approaches, on 4 corpora (different languages and target audiences). The various experiments clearly highlighted two rather simple hybridization methods (soft label and simple concatenation). They also appear to be the most robust on smaller datasets and across various tasks and languages.

Additionally, we ex- plored lesser-known markers such as lexical innovation, concreteness, and imageability. No- tably, we introduced two additional markers for phonological similarity for the first time within this context. Our findings reveal sig- nificant temporal dynamics in these markers closely associated with Walser`s contempora- neous diagnosis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between these markers, leveraging them for classification of the schizophrenic episode.","2024-03","2025-03-01 10:33:10","2025-03-01 10:33:10","2025-03-01 10:33:09","41–60","","","","","","Linguistic markers of schizophrenia","","","","","Association for Computational Linguistics","St. Julians, Malta","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/KLKCZ73J/Nenchev et al. - 2024 - Linguistic markers of schizophrenia a case study of Robert Walser.pdf","","","","Yates, Andrew; Desmet, Bart; Prud'hommeaux, Emily; Zirikly, Ayah; Bedrick, Steven; MacAvaney, Sean; Bar, Kfir; Ireland, Molly; Ophir, Yaakov","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that a Recurrent Neural Network classifier trained exclusively on within-text distributions of such features can reach relatively high levels of overall accuracy (69%) across the 14 categories.

Beyond this general numbers a deeper analysis has been performed in order to evaluate the impact that lexical gaps can have on translation. In particular a distinction has been made between the cases in which the presence of a lexical gap affects translation correctness and completeness at a semantic level.

We explore 23 language features, representative of syntactic complexity and semantic richness, extracted on a dataset of free speech recordings of 138 participants distributed in four languages (Spanish, Catalan, German, Dutch). Data was analyzed using the speech library SIGMA; Pearson`s correlation was computed with Bonferroni correction, and a mixed effects linear regression analysis is done on the significant correlated results. MMSE and the SB-C are found to be correlated with no significant differences across languages. Three features were found to be significantly correlated with the SB-C scores.

Very few studies directly compared the two groups on their spontaneous speech (Gerson et al., 1977; Faber et al., 1983), and no consistent results were found. Our study uses word (based on the word2vec model with moving windows across words) and sentence (transformer based-model) embeddings as features for a machine learning classification model to differentiate between the spontaneous speech of both groups. Additionally, this study uses these measures to differentiate between people with Wernicke`s aphasia and healthy controls. The model is able to classify patients with Wernicke`s aphasia and patients with SSD with a cross-validated accuracy of 81%. Additionally, it is also able to classify patients with Wernicke`s aphasia versus healthy controls and SSD versus healthy controls with cross-validated accuracy of 93.72% and 84.36%, respectively. For the SSD individuals, sentence and/or discourse level features are deemed more informative by the model, whereas for the Wernicke group, only intra-sentential features are more informative.

Given the multimodal nature of this ontology, in which actions are represented through both prototypical visual scenes and linguistic captions, the annotation of aspect in this resource allows us to draw some important considerations about the relation between aspectual meaning and eventualities. The annotation procedure is reported and quantitative data show that, both in the English and Italian corpora, many verbs present aspectual variation, and many eventualities can be represented by locally equivalent verbs with different aspect. The reason why verb aspectual class may vary is investigated. Our analysis makes once more evident that verbs may vary their aspectual properties with respect not only to their argument structure but, more precisely, to the inner qualities of the eventualities they express. Crucially, when eventualities are expressed by equivalent verbs with different aspectual properties, the verbs put on focus different parts of the structure of the eventuality.","2024-05","2025-03-01 10:34:37","2025-03-01 10:34:37","2025-03-01 10:34:36","11–19","","","","","","","","","","","ELRA and ICCL","Torino, Italia","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/5QSZDVQA/Moneglia and Varvara - 2024 - Aspect Variability and the Annotation of Aspect in the IMAGACT Ontology of Action.pdf","","","","Bonial, Claire; Bonn, Julia; Hwang, Jena D.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, challenges persist, especially when transcriptions contain noise, leading to significant drops in performance when Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are applied. Named Entity Recognition (NER), an essential clinical task, is particularly affected by such noise, often termed the ASR-NLP gap. Prior works have primarily studied ASR`s efficiency in clean recordings, leaving a research gap concerning the performance in noisy environments. This paper introduces a novel dataset, BioASR-NER, designed to bridge the ASR-NLP gap in the biomedical domain, focusing on extracting adverse drug reactions and mentions of entities from the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT) exam. Our dataset offers a comprehensive collection of almost 2,000 clean and noisy recordings. In addressing the noise challenge, we present an innovative transcript-cleaning method using GPT-4, investigating both zero-shot and few-shot methodologies. Our study further delves into an error analysis, shedding light on the types of errors in transcription software, corrections by GPT-4, and the challenges GPT-4 faces.

EEG data was recorded when participants were presented with neutral contexts followed by either a proper name or a common noun. Proper names in Chinese often consist of characters that can function independently as words or be combined with other characters to form words, potentially benefiting from the semantic features carried by each character. Using cluster-based permutation tests, we found a larger N400 for common nouns when compared to proper names. Our results suggest that the semantics of characters do play a role in facilitating the processing of proper names. This is consistent with previous behavioral findings on noun processing in Chinese, indicating that common nouns require more cognitive resources to process than proper names. Moreover, our results suggest that proper names are processed differently between alphabetic languages and Chinese language.","2024-05","2025-03-01 10:34:37","2025-03-01 10:34:37","2025-03-01 10:34:36","79–85","","","","","","What`s in a Name?","","","","","ELRA and ICCL","Torino, Italia","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/4SAHHKW2/Jap et al. - 2024 - What`s in a Name Electrophysiological Differences in Processing Proper Nouns in Mandarin Chinese.pdf","","","","Zock, Michael; Chersoni, Emmanuele; Hsu, Yu-Yin; de Deyne, Simon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CogALex 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research has shown that alterations in speech, as well as linguistic and semantic deviations in spontaneous conversation detected using natural language processing, manifest early in AD prior to some other observed cognitive deficits. Recent studies show that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels serve as useful early biomarkers for identifying early AD, but CSF biomarkers are challenging to collect. A simpler alternative that has seen very rapid development is based on the use of plasma biomarkers as a blood draw is minimally invasive. Associating verbal and nonverbal characteristics from speech data with CSF and plasma biomarkers may open the door to less invasive, more efficient methods for early AD detection.

Increased awareness has driven changes in European (European Commission, 2015, 2021; European Parliament, 2016) and International legislation (ODI, 2010), prompting public-sector and other institutions to offer domain-specific content into E2U language to prevent communicative exclusion of those facing cognitive barriers (COGA, 2017; Maaß, 2020; Perego, 2020). However, guidance on what it is that makes language actually ‘easier to understand' is still fragmented and vague.

Detecting these changes is critical to allow early interventions, but research into the earliest signs is challenging, as it requires large longitudinal datasets that are time-consuming and expensive to collect. There is a need for alternative methods for tracking longitudinal language change, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech recognition technologies. We present a novel corpus that can enable this: a corpus of transcripts of public interviews with 20 famous figures, half of whom will eventually be diagnosed with AD, recorded over several decades. We evaluate the corpus by validating patterns of vocabulary richness changes known from literature, such as decline in noun frequency, word length, and several other features. We show that public data could be used to collect longitudinal datasets without causing extra stress for the participant, and that these data can adequately reflect longitudinal AD-related changes in vocabulary richness. Our corpus can provide a valuable starting point for the development of early detection tools and enhance our understanding of how AD affects language over time.","2024-05","2025-03-01 10:34:59","2025-03-01 10:34:59","2025-03-01 10:34:59","10813–10821","","","","","","LoSST-AD","","","","","ELRA and ICCL","Torino, Italia","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/7KWAD3JQ/Petti and Korhonen - 2024 - LoSST-AD A Longitudinal Corpus for Tracking Alzheimer`s Disease Related Changes in Spontaneous Spee.pdf","","","","Calzolari, Nicoletta; Kan, Min-Yen; Hoste, Veronique; Lenci, Alessandro; Sakti, Sakriani; Xue, Nianwen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LREC-COLING 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Efforts to address bias against AAE in NLP systems tend to focus on lexical differences. When the unique structures of AAE are considered, the solution is often to remove or neutralize the differences. This work leverages knowledge about the unique linguistic structures to improve automatic disambiguation of habitual and non-habitual meanings of “be” in naturally produced AAE transcribed speech. Both meanings are employed in AAE but examples of Habitual be are rare in already limited AAE data. Generally, representing additional syntactic information improves semantic disambiguation of habituality. Using an ensemble of classical machine learning models with a representation of the unique POS and dependency patterns of Habitual be, we show that integrating syntactic information improves the identification of habitual uses of “be” by about 65 F1 points over a simple baseline model of n-grams, and as much as 74 points. The success of this approach demonstrates the potential impact when we embrace, rather than neutralize, the structural uniqueness of African American English.","2024-05","2025-03-01 10:34:59","2025-03-01 10:34:59","2025-03-01 10:34:59","10403–10415","","","","","","Leveraging Syntactic Dependencies in Disambiguation","","","","","ELRA and ICCL","Torino, Italia","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/VUPJC747/Previlon et al. - 2024 - Leveraging Syntactic Dependencies in Disambiguation The Case of African American English.pdf","","","","Calzolari, Nicoletta; Kan, Min-Yen; Hoste, Veronique; Lenci, Alessandro; Sakti, Sakriani; Xue, Nianwen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LREC-COLING 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, despite many years of successful research in the field, none of these voice biomarkers are implemented in clinical practice. Beyond the reductive explanation of the lack of explainability of the involved machine learning systems, we look for arguments in the epistemology and sociology of psychiatry. We show that the estimation of diagnoses, the major task in the literature, is of little interest to both clinicians and patients. After tackling the common misbeliefs about diagnosis in psychiatry in a didactic way, we propose a paradigm shift towards the estimation of clinical symptoms and signs, which not only address the limitations raised against diagnosis estimation but also enable the formulation of new machine learning tasks. We hope that this paradigm shift will empower the use of vocal biomarkers in clinical practice. It is however conditional on a change in database labeling practices, but also on a profound change in the speech processing community`s practices towards psychiatry.","2024-05","2025-03-01 10:34:59","2025-03-01 10:34:59","2025-03-01 10:34:59","17603–17613","","","","","","Why Voice Biomarkers of Psychiatric Disorders Are Not Used in Clinical Practice?","","","","","ELRA and ICCL","Torino, Italia","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/C8WSUC7D/Martin and Rouas - 2024 - Why Voice Biomarkers of Psychiatric Disorders Are Not Used in Clinical Practice Deconstructing the.pdf","","","","Calzolari, Nicoletta; Kan, Min-Yen; Hoste, Veronique; Lenci, Alessandro; Sakti, Sakriani; Xue, Nianwen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LREC-COLING 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has sparked great optimism and the development of various digital health tools, but also warnings regarding the predominance of English in the field and calls for linguistically diverse research as well as global, equitable access to novel clinical instruments. To automatically extract clinically relevant features from transcripts in low-resource languages, two approaches are possible: 1) utilizing a limited range of language-specific tools or 2) translating text to English and then extracting the features. We evaluate these approaches for part-of-speech (POS) rates in transcripts of recorded picture descriptions from a cross-sectional study of Icelandic speakers at different stages of Alzheimer`s disease and healthy controls. While the translation method merits further exploration, only a subset of the POS categories show a promising correspondence to the direct extraction from the Icelandic transcripts in our results, indicating that the translation method has to be linguistically validated at the individual POS category level.","2024-05","2025-03-01 10:34:59","2025-03-01 10:34:59","2025-03-01 10:34:59","26–33","","","","","","Speech and Language Biomarkers of Neurodegenerative Conditions","","","","","ELRA and ICCL","Torino, Italia","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/XJ3TABHM/Nowenstein et al. - 2024 - Speech and Language Biomarkers of Neurodegenerative Conditions Developing Cross-Linguistically Vali.pdf","","","","Kokkinakis, Dimitrios; Fraser, Kathleen C.; Themistocleous, Charalambos K.; Fors, Kristina Lundholm; Tsanas, Athanasios; Ohman, Fredrik","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our BERT-based approach is affected more strongly by ASR transcription errors than the simpler and more explainable approach based on linguistic features.","2024-05","2025-03-01 10:37:04","2025-03-01 10:37:04","2025-03-01 10:37:04","15955–15969","","","","","","","","","","","ELRA and ICCL","Torino, Italia","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/EWHGBC4Q/Heitz et al. - 2024 - The Influence of Automatic Speech Recognition on Linguistic Features and Automatic Alzheimer`s Disea.pdf","","","","Calzolari, Nicoletta; Kan, Min-Yen; Hoste, Veronique; Lenci, Alessandro; Sakti, Sakriani; Xue, Nianwen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LREC-COLING 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Detecting these changes is critical to allow early interventions, but research into the earliest signs is challenging, as it requires large longitudinal datasets that are time-consuming and expensive to collect. There is a need for alternative methods for tracking longitudinal language change, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech recognition technologies. We present a novel corpus that can enable this: a corpus of transcripts of public interviews with 20 famous figures, half of whom will eventually be diagnosed with AD, recorded over several decades. We evaluate the corpus by validating patterns of vocabulary richness changes known from literature, such as decline in noun frequency, word length, and several other features. We show that public data could be used to collect longitudinal datasets without causing extra stress for the participant, and that these data can adequately reflect longitudinal AD-related changes in vocabulary richness. Our corpus can provide a valuable starting point for the development of early detection tools and enhance our understanding of how AD affects language over time.","2024-05","2025-03-01 10:37:04","2025-03-01 10:37:04","2025-03-01 10:37:04","10813–10821","","","","","","LoSST-AD","","","","","ELRA and ICCL","Torino, Italia","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/NDDEPAF9/Petti and Korhonen - 2024 - LoSST-AD A Longitudinal Corpus for Tracking Alzheimer`s Disease Related Changes in Spontaneous Spee.pdf","","","","Calzolari, Nicoletta; Kan, Min-Yen; Hoste, Veronique; Lenci, Alessandro; Sakti, Sakriani; Xue, Nianwen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LREC-COLING 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an alternative to fitting model parameters directly, we propose a novel method by which a Transformer DL model (GPT-2) pre-trained on general English text is paired with an artificially degraded version of itself (GPT-D), to compute the ratio between these two models' perplexities on language from cognitively healthy and impaired individuals. This technique approaches state-of-the-art performance on text data from a widely used “Cookie Theft” picture description task, and unlike established alternatives also generalizes well to spontaneous conversations. Furthermore, GPT-D generates text with characteristics known to be associated with AD, demonstrating the induction of dementia-related linguistic anomalies.

A variety of preliminary screening procedures are potentially suitable for automation, and one such domain that has remained underexplored to date is that of structured clinical interviews. A task-specific dialogue agent is needed to automate the collection of conversational speech for further (either manual or automated) analysis, and to build such an agent, a dialogue manager must be trained to respond to patient utterances in a manner similar to a human interviewer. To facilitate the development of such an agent, we propose an annotation schema for assigning dialogue act labels to utterances in patient-interviewer conversations collected as part of a clinically-validated cognitive health screening task. We build a labeled corpus using the schema, and show that it is characterized by high inter-annotator agreement. We establish a benchmark dialogue act classification model for the corpus, thereby providing a proof of concept for the proposed annotation schema.

The main goal of this paper was to develop a generic segmentation system for narratives of neuropsychological language tests. We explored the performance of our previous single-dataset-trained sentence segmentation architecture in a richer scenario involving three new datasets used to diagnose cognitive impairments, comprising different stories and two types of stimulus presentation for eliciting narratives — visual and oral — via illustrated story-book and sequence of scenes, and by retelling. Also, we proposed and evaluated three modifications to our previous RCNN architecture: (i) the inclusion of a Linear Chain CRF; (ii) the inclusion of a self-attention mechanism; and (iii) the replacement of the LSTM recurrent layer by a Quasi-Recurrent Neural Network layer.

To identify, categorize and quantify salient features of patient-provider communication, to model interactive processes in medical encounters and to design digital interactive medical services, two important instruments have been developed: (1) medical interaction analysis systems with the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS) as the most widely used by medical practitioners and (2) dialogue act annotation schemes with ISO 24617-2 as a multidimensional taxonomy of interoperable semantic concepts widely used for corpus annotation and dialogue systems design. Neither instrument fits all purposes. In this paper, we perform a systematic comparative analysis of the categories defined in the RIAS and ISO taxonomies.

Anomia, or word finding difficulty, is a prominent symptom of aphasia, which is often diagnosed through confrontation naming tasks. In the clinical setting, identification of correctness in responses to these naming tasks is useful for diagnosis, but currently is a labor-intensive process. This year`s Post-Stroke Speech Transcription Challenge provides an opportunity to explore ways of automating this process. In this work, we focus on Task B of the challenge, i.e. identification of response correctness. We study whether a simple aggregation of using the 1-best automatic speech recognition (ASR) output and acoustic features could help predict response correctness. This was motivated by the hypothesis that acoustic features could provide complementary information to the (imperfect) ASR transcripts. We trained several classifiers using various sets of acoustic features standard in speech processing literature in an attempt to improve over the 1-best ASR baseline. Results indicated that our approach to using the acoustic features did not beat the simple baseline, at least on this challenge dataset. This suggests that ASR robustness still plays a significant role in the correctness detection task, which has yet to benefit from acoustic features.","2022-06","2025-03-01 10:37:53","2025-03-01 10:37:53","2025-03-01 10:37:53","56–61","","","","","","Post-Stroke Speech Transcription Challenge (Task B)","","","","","European Language Resources Association","Marseille, France","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/BM942H8B/Tran - 2022 - Post-Stroke Speech Transcription Challenge (Task B) Correctness Detection in Anomia Diagnosis with.pdf","","","","Kokkinakis, Dimitrios; Themistocleous, Charalambos K.; Fors, Kristina Lundholm; Tsanas, Athanasios; Fraser, Kathleen C.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","RaPID 2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, one of the main symptoms shared along the spectrum is social interaction impairments that can be explored through acoustic analysis of speech production. In this paper, we compare 14 Italian-speaking children with ASD and 14 typically developing peers. Accordingly, we extracted and selected the acoustic features related to prosody, quality of voice, loudness, and spectral distribution using the parameter set eGeMAPS provided by the openSMILE feature extraction toolkit. We implemented four supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the extraction performances. Our findings show that Decision Trees (DTs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are the best-performing methods. The overall DT models reach a 100% recall on all the trials, meaning they correctly recognise autistic features. However, half of its models overfit, while SVMs are more consistent. One of the results of the work is the creation of a speech pipeline to extract Italian speech biomarkers typical of ASD by comparing our results with studies based on other languages.

We show that polarity detection can be improved when done in a multitask framework in combination with typeof use detection. This confirms the observations made manually on several datasets, namely that the polarity of a tweet iscorrelated to the type of term use (misuses are mostly negative whereas medical uses are neutral).

At the time, DARPA had adopted the common task research management paradigm to impose additional rigor on their programs by also providing shared objectives, data and evaluation methods. Early successes underscored the promise of this paradigm but also the need for a standing infrastructure to host and distribute the shared data. During LDC`s initial five year grant, it became clear that the demand for linguistic data could not easily be met by the existing providers and that a dedicated data center could add capacity first for data collection and shortly thereafter for annotation. The expanding purview required expansions of LDC`s technical infrastructure including systems support and software development. An open question for the center would be its role in other kinds of research beyond data development.

Several studies have explored using only the acoustic and linguistic information of conversational speech as diagnostic material, with some success. To accelerate this research, we recorded natural conversations between 128 elderly people living in four different regions of Japan and interviewers, who also administered the Hasegawa`s Dementia Scale-Revised (HDS-R), a cognitive impairment test. Using our elderly speech corpus and dementia test results, we propose an SVM-based screening method which can detect dementia using the acoustic features of conversational speech even when regional dialects are present. We accomplish this by omitting some acoustic features, to limit the negative effect of differences between dialects. When using our proposed method, a dementia detection accuracy rate of about 91% was achieved for speakers from two regions. When speech from four regions was used in a second experiment, the discrimination rate fell to 76.6%, but this may have been due to using only sentence-level acoustic features in the second experiment, instead of sentence and phoneme-level features as in the previous experiment. This is an on-going research project, and additional investigation is needed to understand differences in the acoustic characteristics of phoneme units in the conversational speech collected from these four regions, to determine whether the removal of formants and other features can improve the dementia detection rate.","2022-06","2025-03-01 10:38:16","2025-03-01 10:38:16","2025-03-01 10:38:15","1016–1022","","","","","","","","","","","European Language Resources Association","Marseille, France","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/5VEIZFQK/Fukuda et al. - 2022 - Elderly Conversational Speech Corpus with Cognitive Impairment Test and Pilot Dementia Detection Exp.pdf","","","","Calzolari, Nicoletta; Béchet, Frédéric; Blache, Philippe; Choukri, Khalid; Cieri, Christopher; Declerck, Thierry; Goggi, Sara; Isahara, Hitoshi; Maegaard, Bente; Mariani, Joseph; Mazo, Hélène; Odijk, Jan; Piperidis, Stelios","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LREC 2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenge consisted of two tasks. Task A asked challengers to build an automatic speech recognizer (ASR) for phonemic transcription of the PSST samples, evaluated in terms of phoneme error rate (PER) as well as a finer-grained metric derived from phonological feature theory, feature error rate (FER). The best model had a 9.9% FER / 20.0% PER, improving on our baseline by a relative 18% and 24%, respectively. Task B approximated a downstream assessment task, asking challengers to identify whether each recording contained a correctly pronounced target word.

Many of these studies are based on relatively small datasets in homogeneous populations, which has the associated risk that the models may not perform adequately on new data in real clinical practice. The nature of serious mental illness is that it is hard to define, hard to capture, and requires frequent monitoring, which leads to imperfect data where attribute and class noise are common. With the goal of an effective AI-mediated clinical decision support system, there must be computational safeguards placed on the models used in order to avoid spurious predictions and thus allow humans to review data in the settings where models are unstable or bound not to generalize. This paper describes two approaches to implementing safeguards: (1) the determination of cases in which models are unstable by means of attribute and class based outlier detection and (2) finding the extent to which models show inductive bias. These safeguards are illustrated in the automated scoring of a story recall task via natural language processing methods. With the integration of human-in-the-loop machine learning in the clinical implementation process, incorporating safeguards such as these into the models will offer patients increased protection from spurious predictions.","2021-06","2025-03-01 10:38:16","2025-03-01 10:38:16","2025-03-01 10:38:15","181–191","","","","","","Safeguarding against spurious AI-based predictions","","","","","Association for Computational Linguistics","Online","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/A4JMC5VH/Chandler et al. - 2021 - Safeguarding against spurious AI-based predictions The case of automated verbal memory assessment.pdf","","","","Goharian, Nazli; Resnik, Philip; Yates, Andrew; Ireland, Molly; Niederhoffer, Kate; Resnik, Rebecca","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CLPsych 2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To improve detection accuracies, increasing the amount of data or the number of linguistic features have been two applicable approaches. However, acquiring additional clinical data can be expensive, and hand-crafting features is burdensome. In this paper, we take a third approach, proposing Consensus Networks (CNs), a framework to classify after reaching agreements between modalities. We divide linguistic features into non-overlapping subsets according to their modalities, and let neural networks learn low-dimensional representations that agree with each other. These representations are passed into a classifier network. All neural networks are optimized iteratively. In this paper, we also present two methods that improve the performance of CNs. We then present ablation studies to illustrate the effectiveness of modality division. To understand further what happens in CNs, we visualize the representations during training. Overall, using all of the 413 linguistic features, our models significantly outperform traditional classifiers, which are used by the state-of-the-art papers.","2019-06","2025-03-01 10:38:40","2025-03-01 10:38:40","2025-03-01 10:38:40","1431–1441","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computational Linguistics","Minneapolis, Minnesota","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/SWNTLYZU/Zhu et al. - 2019 - Detecting cognitive impairments by agreeing on interpretations of linguistic features.pdf","","","","Burstein, Jill; Doran, Christy; Solorio, Thamar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NAACL-HLT 2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
