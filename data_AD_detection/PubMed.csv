Early detection and intervention are the most effective prevention methods currently. Compared with traditional detection methods such as traditional scale tests, electroencephalograms, and magnetic resonance imaging, speech analysis is more convenient for automatic large-scale Alzheimer's disease detection and has attracted extensive attention from researchers. In particular, deep learning-based speech analysis and language processing techniques for Alzheimer's disease detection have been studied and achieved impressive results. METHODS: To integrate the latest research progresses, hundreds of relevant papers from ACM, DBLP, IEEE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science electronic databases, and other sources were retrieved. We used these keywords for paper search: (Alzheimer OR dementia OR cognitive impairment) AND (speech OR voice OR audio) AND (deep learning OR neural network). CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-two papers were finally retained after screening. We reviewed and presented the speech databases, deep learning methods, and model performances of these studies.

However, current diagnostic techniques are not designed for frequent mass screening, delaying therapeutic intervention and worsening prognoses. To be able to detect AD at an early stage, ideally at a pre-clinical stage, speech analysis emerges as a simple low-cost non-invasive procedure. OBJECTIVES: In this work it is our objective to do a systematic review about speech-based detection and classification of Alzheimer's Disease with the purpose of identifying the most effective algorithms and best practices. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed from Jan 2015 up to May 2020 using ScienceDirect, PubMed and DBLP. Articles were screened by title, abstract and full text as needed. A manual complementary search among the references of the included papers was also performed. Inclusion criteria and search strategies were defined a priori. RESULTS: We were able: to identify the main resources that can support the development of decision support systems for AD, to list speech features that are correlated with the linguistic and acoustic footprint of the disease, to recognize the data models that can provide robust results and to observe the performance indicators that were reported. DISCUSSION: A computational system with the adequate elements combination, based on the identified best-practices, can point to a whole new diagnostic approach, leading to better insights about AD symptoms and its disease patterns, creating conditions to promote a longer life span as well as an improvement in patient quality of life. The clinically relevant results that were identified can be used to establish a reference system and help to define research guidelines for future developments.","2022-01-11","2025-02-19 20:38:07","2025-02-19 20:38:07","","27","","1","9","","Bioengineering (Basel)","Speech- and Language-Based Classification of Alzheimer's Disease","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35049736 PMCID: PMC8772820","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/EK3Z9DQ7/Vigo et al. - 2022 - Speech- and Language-Based Classification of Alzheimer's Disease A Systematic Review.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35049736","","Alzheimer’s disease (AD); classification; features; machine learning (ML); mild cognitive impairment (MCI); speech","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper systematically reviews the technologies to detect the onset of AD from spontaneous speech, including data collection, feature extraction and classification. First the paper formulates the task of automatic detection of AD and describes the process of data collection. Then, feature extractors from speech data and transcripts are reviewed, which mainly contains acoustic features from speech and linguistic features from text.

Language difficulties are a major problem in dementia as linguistic skills break down. Current methods do not provide robust tools to capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. Early detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) from spontaneous speech overcomes the limitations of earlier approaches as it is less time consuming, can be done at home, and is relatively inexpensive. In this work, we re-implement the existing NLP methods, which used CNN-LSTM architectures and targeted features from conversational transcripts. Our work sheds light on why the accuracy of these models drops to 72.92% on the ADReSS dataset, whereas, they gave state of the art results on the DementiaBank dataset. Further, we build upon these language input-based recurrent neural networks by devising an end-to-end deep learning-based solution that performs a binary classification of Alzheimer's Dementia from the spontaneous speech of the patients. We utilize the ADReSS dataset for all our implementations and explore the deep learning-based methods of combining acoustic features into a common vector using recurrent units. Our approach of combining acoustic features using the Speech-GRU improves the accuracy by 2% in comparison to acoustic baselines. When further enriched by targeted features, the Speech-GRU performs better than acoustic baselines by 6.25%. We propose a bi-modal approach for AD classification and discuss the merits and opportunities of our approach.","2021","2025-02-19 20:38:21","2025-02-19 20:38:21","","623607","","","13","","Front Aging Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33613269 PMCID: PMC7893079","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/YLGPAAGX/Mahajan and Baths - 2021 - Acoustic and Language Based Deep Learning Approaches for Alzheimer's Dementia Detection From Spontan.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33613269","","affective computing; cognitive decline detection; computational paralinguistics; deep learning; natural language processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study tests an automated analysis of natural speech as an inexpensive, non-invasive screening tool for AD co-pathology in biologically-confirmed cohorts of LBD patients with AD co-pathology (SYN + AD) and without (SYN-AD). METHODS: We analyzed lexical-semantic and acoustic features of picture descriptions using automated methods in 22 SYN + AD and 38 SYN-AD patients stratified using AD CSF biomarkers or autopsy diagnosis. Speech markers of AD co-pathology were identified using best subset regression, and their diagnostic discrimination was tested using receiver operating characteristic. ANCOVAs compared measures between groups covarying for demographic differences and cognitive disease severity. We tested relations with CSF tau levels, and compared speech measures between PDD and DLB clinical disorders in the same cohort. RESULTS: Age of acquisition of nouns (p = 0.034, |d| = 0.77) and lexical density (p = 0.0064, |d| = 0.72) were reduced in SYN + AD, and together showed excellent discrimination for SYN + AD vs. SYN-AD (95% sensitivity, 66% specificity; AUC = 0.82). Lower lexical density was related to higher CSF t-Tau levels (R = -0.41, p = 0.0021). Clinically-diagnosed PDD vs. DLB did not differ on any speech features. CONCLUSION: AD co-pathology may result in a deviant natural speech profile in LBD characterized by specific lexical-semantic impairments, not detectable by clinical disorder diagnosis.

This study explores significant standalone speech features to recognize dementia. The primary contribution of this work is to identify a compact set of speech features that aid in the dementia recognition process. The secondary contribution is to leverage machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for the recognition task. Speech samples from the Pitt corpus in Dementia Bank are utilized for the present study. The critical speech feature set of prosodic, voice quality and cepstral features has been proposed for the task. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of machine learning (87.6 percent) over deep learning (85 percent) models for recognizing Dementia using the compact speech feature combination, along with lower time and memory consumption.

Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly natural language processing (NLP), has recently been increasingly used for early prediction of AD through speech. Yet, relatively few studies exist on using large language models, especially GPT-3, to aid in the early diagnosis of dementia. In this work, we show for the first time that GPT-3 can be utilized to predict dementia from spontaneous speech. Specifically, we leverage the vast semantic knowledge encoded in the GPT-3 model to generate text embedding, a vector representation of the transcribed text from speech, that captures the semantic meaning of the input. We demonstrate that the text embedding can be reliably used to (1) distinguish individuals with AD from healthy controls, and (2) infer the subject's cognitive testing score, both solely based on speech data. We further show that text embedding considerably outperforms the conventional acoustic feature-based approach and even performs competitively with prevailing fine-tuned models. Together, our results suggest that GPT-3 based text embedding is a viable approach for AD assessment directly from speech and has the potential to improve early diagnosis of dementia.","2022-12","2025-02-19 20:40:07","2025-02-19 20:40:07","","e0000168","","12","1","","PLOS Digit Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36812634 PMCID: PMC9931366","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/QJMR32SK/Agbavor and Liang - 2022 - Predicting dementia from spontaneous speech using large language models.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36812634","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Referential communication tasks (RCTs) are used to examine a speaker's capability to select and verbally code the characteristics of an object in interactive conversation. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used contextualized word representations from Natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate how well RCTs are able to distinguish between people with AD and cognitively healthy older adults. METHODS: We adapted machine learning techniques to analyze manually transcribed speech transcripts in an RCT from 28 older adults, including 12 with AD and 16 cognitively healthy older adults. Two approaches were applied to classify these speech transcript samples: 1) using clinically relevant linguistic features, 2) using machine learned representations derived by a state-of-art pretrained NLP transfer learning model, Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT) based classification model. RESULTS: The results demonstrated the superior performance of AD detection using a designed transfer learning NLP algorithm. Moreover, the analysis showed that transcripts of a single image yielded high accuracies in AD detection. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that RCT may be useful as a diagnostic tool for AD, and that the task can be simplified to a subset of images without significant sacrifice to diagnostic accuracy, which can make RCT an easier and more practical tool for AD diagnosis. The results also demonstrate the potential of RCT as a tool to better understand cognitive deficits from the perspective of discourse production in people with AD.","2022","2025-02-19 20:40:14","2025-02-19 20:40:14","","1385-1398","","3","86","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35213368","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35213368","","Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer’s disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Communication; early diagnosis; Humans; natural language processing; Natural Language Processing; Speech; transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent deep learning models have exploited speech pauses to achieve highly accurate dementia detection, but have not exploited the interpretability of speech pauses, i.e., what and how positions and lengths of speech pauses affect the result of dementia detection. In this paper, we will study the positions and lengths of dementia-sensitive pauses using adversarial learning approaches. Specifically, we first utilize an adversarial attack approach by adding the perturbation to the speech pauses of the testing samples, aiming to reduce the confidence levels of the detection model. Then, we apply an adversarial training approach to evaluate the impact of the perturbation in training samples on the detection model. We examine the interpretability from the perspectives of model accuracy, pause context, and pause length. We found that some pauses are more sensitive to dementia than other pauses from the model's perspective, e.g., speech pauses near to the verb ""is"". Increasing lengths of sensitive pauses or adding sensitive pauses leads the model inference to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), while decreasing the lengths of sensitive pauses or deleting sensitive pauses leads to non-AD.","2022-05","2025-02-19 20:40:55","2025-02-19 20:40:55","","6462-6466","","","2022","","Proc IEEE Int Conf Acoust Speech Signal Process","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37064829 PMCID: PMC10102974","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/PARS9NGU/Zhu et al. - 2022 - TOWARDS INTERPRETABILITY OF SPEECH PAUSE IN DEMENTIA DETECTION USING ADVERSARIAL LEARNING.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37064829","","acoustic feature; dementia detection; interpretability; Speech pauses; spontaneous speech","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the speech dataset available for this research is extremely limited because the collection process of speech and baseline data from patients with dementia in clinical settings is expensive. In this paper, we study the spontaneous speech dataset from a recent ADReSS challenge, a Cookie Theft Picture (CTP) dataset with balanced groups of participants in age, gender, and cognitive status. We explore state-of-the-art deep transfer learning techniques from image, audio, speech, and language domains. We envision that one advantage of transfer learning is to eliminate the design of handcrafted features based on the tasks and datasets. Transfer learning further mitigates the limited dementia-relevant speech data problem by inheriting knowledge from similar but much larger datasets. Specifically, we built a variety of transfer learning models using commonly employed MobileNet (image), YAMNet (audio), Mockingjay (speech), and BERT (text) models. Results indicated that the transfer learning models of text data showed significantly better performance than those of audio data. Performance gains of the text models may be due to the high similarity between the pre-training text dataset and the CTP text dataset. Our multi-modal transfer learning introduced a slight improvement in accuracy, demonstrating that audio and text data provide limited complementary information. Multi-task transfer learning resulted in limited improvements in classification and a negative impact in regression. By analyzing the meaning behind the AD/non-AD labels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, we observed that the inconsistency between labels and scores could limit the performance of the multi-task learning, especially when the outputs of the single-task models are highly consistent with the corresponding labels/scores. In sum, we conducted a large comparative analysis of varying transfer learning models focusing less on model customization but more on pre-trained models and pre-training datasets. We revealed insightful relations among models, data types, and data labels in this research area.","2021-05","2025-02-19 20:41:01","2025-02-19 20:41:01","","624683","","","3","","Front Comput Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 34046588 PMCID: PMC8153512","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/QDT5CCQ8/Zhu et al. - 2021 - Exploring Deep Transfer Learning Techniques for Alzheimer's Dementia Detection.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046588","","Alzheimer’s Disease; Deep learning; Dementia; Early Detection; Speech analysis; Spontaneous speech; Transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We determined the aspects of speech and language that exhibited significant longitudinal change over 18 months. Nine acoustic and linguistic measures were combined to create a novel composite score. The speech composite exhibited significant correlations with primary and secondary clinical endpoints and a similar effect size for detecting longitudinal change. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using automated speech processing to characterize longitudinal change in early AD. Speech-based composite scores could be used to monitor change and detect response to treatment in future research. HIGHLIGHTS: Longitudinal speech samples were analyzed to characterize speech changes in early AD.Acoustic and linguistic measures showed significant change over 18 months.A novel speech composite score was computed to characterize longitudinal change.The speech composite correlated with primary and secondary trial endpoints.Automated speech analysis could facilitate remote, high frequency monitoring in AD.","2023","2025-02-19 20:41:08","2025-02-19 20:41:08","","e12445","","2","15","","Alzheimers Dement (Amst)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 37361261 PMCID: PMC10286224","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/2JMLUHRM/Robin et al. - 2023 - Automated detection of progressive speech changes in early Alzheimer's disease.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37361261","","Alzheimer's disease; digital biomarkers; language; mild cognitive impairment; natural language processing; speech","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study delves into the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques by leveraging paralinguistic features extracted directly from a brief spontaneous speech (SS) protocol. We aimed to explore the capability of ML techniques to discriminate between different degrees of cognitive impairment based on SS. Furthermore, for the first time, this study investigates the relationship between paralinguistic features from SS and cognitive function within the AD spectrum. METHODS: Physical-acoustic features were extracted from voice recordings of patients evaluated in a memory unit who underwent a SS protocol. We implemented several ML models evaluated via cross-validation to identify individuals without cognitive impairment (subjective cognitive decline, SCD), with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and with dementia due to AD (ADD). In addition, we established models capable of predicting cognitive domain performance based on a comprehensive neuropsychological battery from Fundació Ace (NBACE) using SS-derived information. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that, based on a paralinguistic analysis of sound, it is possible to identify individuals with ADD (F1 = 0.92) and MCI (F1 = 0.84). Furthermore, our models, based on physical acoustic information, exhibited correlations greater than 0.5 for predicting the cognitive domains of attention, memory, executive functions, language, and visuospatial ability. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show the potential of a brief and cost-effective SS protocol in distinguishing between different degrees of cognitive impairment and forecasting performance in cognitive domains commonly affected within the AD spectrum. Our results demonstrate a high correspondence with protocols traditionally used to assess cognitive function. Overall, it opens up novel prospects for developing screening tools and remote disease monitoring.","2024-02-02","2025-02-19 20:41:15","2025-02-19 20:41:15","","26","","1","16","","Alzheimers Res Ther","Unveiling the sound of the cognitive status","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38308366 PMCID: PMC10835990","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/MEJWDG97/García-Gutiérrez et al. - 2024 - Unveiling the sound of the cognitive status Machine Learning-based speech analysis in the Alzheimer.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38308366","","Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer’s disease; Automated pattern recognition; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression; Early diagnosis; Humans; Machine Learning; Mild cognitive impairment; Neuropsychological tests; Neuropsychological Tests; Speech; Speech acoustics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Significant differences in speech have previously been found by comparing the press conference transcripts of President Bush and President Reagan, who was later diagnosed with AD. OBJECTIVE: In the current study, we explored whether the patterns previously established in the single AD-healthy control (HC) participant pair apply to a larger group of individuals who later receive AD diagnosis. METHODS: We replicated previous methods on two larger corpora of longitudinal spontaneous speech samples of public figures, consisting of 10 and 9 AD-HC participant pairs. As we failed to find generalizable patterns of language change using previous methodology, we proposed alternative methods for data analysis, investigating the benefits of using different language features and their change with age, and compiling the single features into aggregate scores. RESULTS: The single features that showed the strongest results were moving average type:token ratio (MATTR) and pronoun-related features. The aggregate scores performed better than the single features, with lexical diversity capturing a similar change in two-thirds of the participants. CONCLUSION: Capturing universal patterns of language change prior to AD can be challenging, but the decline in lexical diversity and changes in MATTR and pronoun-related features act as promising measures that reflect the cognitive changes in many participants.","2023","2025-02-19 20:41:21","2025-02-19 20:41:21","","547-564","","2","92","","J Alzheimers Dis","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36776053","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36776053","","Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; cognitive dysfunction; Cognitive Dysfunction; dementia; early diagnosis; Humans; language; Language; Language Disorders; medical informatics; natural language processing; speech; Speech","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we explore the voice commands using a Voice-Assistant System (VAS), i.e., Amazon Alexa, from 40 older adults who were either Healthy Control (HC) participants or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) participants, age 65 or older. We evaluated the data collected from voice commands, cognitive assessments, and interviews and surveys using a structured protocol. We extracted 163 unique command-relevant features from each participant's use of the VAS. We then built machine-learning models including 1-layer/2-layer neural networks, support vector machines, decision tree, and random forest, for classification and comparison with standard cognitive assessment scores, e.g., Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Our classification models using fusion features achieved an accuracy of 68%, and our regression model resulted in a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) score of 3.53. Our Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models using selected features achieved higher classification accuracy 80-90%. Finally, we analyzed the contribution of each feature set to the model output, thus revealing the commands and features most useful in inferring the participants' cognitive status. We found that features of overall performance, features of music-related commands, features of call-related commands, and features from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) were the top-four feature sets most impactful on inference accuracy.

We systematically review these articles to understand the effectiveness of this approach, identify any issues and report the main findings that can guide further research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science for articles published in English between 2013 and 2019. We performed a systematic literature review to answer 5 key questions: (1) What were the characteristics of participant groups? (2) What language data were collected? (3) What features of speech and language were the most informative? (4) What methods were used to classify between groups? (5) What classification performance was achieved? RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified 33 eligible studies and 5 main findings: participants' demographic variables (especially age ) were often unbalanced between AD and control group; spontaneous speech data were collected most often; informative language features were related to word retrieval and semantic, syntactic, and acoustic impairment; neural nets, support vector machines, and decision trees performed well in AD detection, and support vector machines and decision trees performed well in decline detection; and average classification accuracy was 89% in AD and 82% in mild cognitive impairment detection versus healthy control groups. CONCLUSION: The systematic literature review supported the argument that language and speech could successfully be used to detect dementia automatically.

Annual International Conference","","2694-0604","10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871204","","As the most common neurodegenerative disease among older adults, Alzheimer's disease (AD) would lead to loss of memory, impaired language and judgment, gait disorders, and other cognitive deficits severe enough to interfere with daily activities and significantly diminish quality of life. Recent research has shown promising results in automatic AD diagnosis via speech, leveraging the advances of deep learning in the audio domain. However, most existing studies rely on a centralized learning framework which requires subjects' voice data to be gathered to a central server, raising severe privacy concerns. To resolve this, in this paper, we propose the first federated-learning-based approach for achieving automatic AD diagnosis via spontaneous speech analysis while ensuring the subjects' data privacy. Extensive experiments under various federated learning settings on the ADReSS challenge dataset show that the proposed model can achieve high accuracy for AD detection while achieving privacy preservation. To ensure fairness of the model performance across clients in federated settings, we further deploy fair aggregation mechanisms, particularly q-FEDAvg and q-FEDSgd, which greatly reduces the algorithmic biases due to the data heterogeneity among the clients. Clinical Relevance -The experiments were conducted on publicly available clinical datasets. No humans or animals were involved.","2022-07","2025-02-19 20:41:53","2025-02-19 20:41:53","","1362-1365","","","2022","","Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36086432","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36086432","","Alzheimer Disease; Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Privacy; Quality of Life; Speech","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Timely and accurate detection is crucial for early intervention. Advancements in artificial intelligence present significant potential for using machine learning to aid in early detection. OBJECTIVE: Summarize the state-of-the-art machine learning-based approaches for dementia prediction, focusing on non-invasive methods, as the burden on the patients is lower. Specifically, the analysis of gait and speech performance can offer insights into cognitive health through clinically cost-effective screening methods. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The search was performed on three electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed) to identify the relevant studies published between 2017 to 2022. A total of 40 papers were selected for review. RESULTS: The most common machine learning methods employed were support vector machine followed by deep learning. Studies suggested the use of multimodal approaches as they can provide comprehensive and better prediction performance. Deep learning application in gait studies is still in the early stages as few studies have applied it. Moreover, including features of whole body movement contribute to better classification accuracy. Regarding speech studies, the combination of different parameters (acoustic, linguistic, cognitive testing) produced better results. CONCLUSIONS: The review highlights the potential of machine learning, particularly non-invasive approaches, in the early prediction of dementia. The comparable prediction accuracies of manual and automatic speech analysis indicate an imminent fully automated approach for dementia detection.","2024","2025-02-19 20:45:40","2025-02-19 20:45:40","","1-27","","1","100","","J Alzheimers Dis","Machine Learning Approaches for Dementia Detection Through Speech and Gait Analysis","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 38848181 PMCID: PMC11307068","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/9NQEWFNK/Al-Hammadi et al. - 2024 - Machine Learning Approaches for Dementia Detection Through Speech and Gait Analysis A Systematic Li.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38848181","","Alzheimer’s disease; cognitive impairment; deep learning; Dementia; dementia disorders; gait analysis; Gait Analysis; Humans; machine learning; Machine Learning; non-invasive; Speech; speech analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHOD: This study analyzed connected speech from 80 participants and categorized the participants into early-AD and normal control (NC) groups. The participants underwent amyloid-β positron emission tomography scans, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and comprehensive neuropsychological testing. Participants' speech data from a picture description task were examined. A total of 15 linguistic features were analyzed to classify groups and predict cognitive performance. RESULTS: We found notable linguistic differences between the early-AD and NC groups in lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, and language disfluency. Using machine learning classifiers (SVM, KNN, and RF), we achieved up to 88% accuracy in distinguishing early-AD patients from normal controls, with mean length of utterance (MLU) and long pauses ratio (LPR) serving as core linguistic indicators. Moreover, the integration of linguistic indicators with biomarkers significantly improved predictive accuracy for AD. Regression analysis also highlighted crucial linguistic features, such as MLU, LPR, Type-to-Token ratio (TTR), and passive construction ratio (PCR), which were sensitive to changes in cognitive function.

However, no studies have yet determined which type of features provides better screening effectiveness, especially in the large aging population of China. OBJECTIVE: Firstly, to compare the screening effectiveness of acoustic features, linguistic features, and their combination using the same dataset. Secondly, to develop Chinese automated diagnosis model using self-collected natural discourse data obtained from native Chinese speakers. METHODS: A total of 92 participants from communities in Shanghai, completed MoCA-B and a picture description task based on the Cookie Theft under the guidance of trained operators, and were divided into three groups including AD, MCI, and heathy control (HC) based on their MoCA-B score. Acoustic features (Pitches, Jitter, Shimmer, MFCCs, Formants) and linguistic features (part-of-speech, type-token ratio, information words, information units) are extracted. The machine algorithms used in this study included logistic regression, random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayesian (GNB), and k-Nearest neighbor (kNN). The validation accuracies of the same ML model using acoustic features, linguistic features, and their combination were compared. RESULTS: The accuracy with linguistic features is generally higher than acoustic features in training. The highest accuracy to differentiate HC and AD is 80.77% achieved by SVM, based on all the features extracted from the speech data, while the highest accuracy to differentiate HC and AD or MCI is 80.43% achieved by RF, based only on linguistic features.

The language change in patients with AD is an important signal of their cognitive status, which potentially helps in early diagnosis. In this study, we developed a transfer learning model based on speech and natural language processing (NLP) technology for the early diagnosis of AD. The lack of large datasets limits the use of complex neural network models without feature engineering, while transfer learning can effectively solve this problem. The transfer learning model is firstly pre-trained on large text datasets to get the pre-trained language model, and then, based on such a model, an AD classification model is performed on small training sets. Concretely, a distilled bidirectional encoder representation (distilBert) embedding, combined with a logistic regression classifier, is used to distinguish AD from normal controls. The model experiment was evaluated on Alzheimer's dementia recognition through spontaneous speech datasets in 2020, including the balanced 78 healthy controls (HC) and 78 patients with AD. The accuracy of the proposed model is 0.88, which is almost equivalent to the champion score in the challenge and a considerable improvement over the baseline of 75% established by organizers of the challenge. As a result, the transfer learning method in this study improves AD prediction, which does not only reduces the need for feature engineering but also addresses the lack of sufficiently large datasets.","2022","2025-02-19 20:47:03","2025-02-19 20:47:03","","772592","","","10","","Front Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35493375 PMCID: PMC9043451","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/DACEQTDI/Liu et al. - 2022 - A Transfer Learning Method for Detecting Alzheimer's Disease Based on Speech and Natural Language Pr.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35493375","","Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer's disease; BERT; Humans; machine learning; Machine Learning; natural language processing; Natural Language Processing; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Speech; transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper concerns using Spontaneous Speech (ADReSS) Challenge of Interspeech 2020 to classify Alzheimer's dementia. We used (1) VGGish, a deep, pretrained, Tensorflow model as an audio feature extractor, and Scikit-learn classifiers to detect signs of dementia in speech. Three classifiers (LinearSVM, Perceptron, 1NN) were 59.1% accurate, which was 3% above the best-performing baseline models trained on the acoustic features used in the challenge. We also proposed (2) DemCNN, a new PyTorch raw waveform-based convolutional neural network model that was 63.6% accurate, 7% more accurate then the best-performing baseline linear discriminant analysis model. We discovered that audio transfer learning with a pretrained VGGish feature extractor performs better than the baseline approach using automatically extracted acoustic features. Our DepCNN exhibits good generalization capabilities. Both methods presented in this paper offer progress toward new, innovative, and more effective computer-based screening of dementia through spontaneous speech.","2020","2025-02-19 20:47:07","2025-02-19 20:47:07","","623237","","","11","","Front Psychol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33643116 PMCID: PMC7907518","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/QX3DLAI6/Chlasta and Wołk - 2020 - Towards Computer-Based Automated Screening of Dementia Through Spontaneous Speech.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643116","","affective computing; convolutional neural network; dementia detection; machine learning; mental health monitoring; prosodic analysis; speech technology; transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The basis of any automatic SLAMs is a machine learning (ML) classifier that is trained on participants' speech and language. However, language tasks, recording media, and modalities impact the performance of ML classifiers. Thus, this research has focused on evaluating the effects of the above-mentioned factors on the performance of ML classifiers that can be used for dementia assessment. METHODOLOGY: Our methodology includes the following steps: (1) Collecting speech and language datasets from patients and healthy controls; (2) Using feature engineering methods which include feature extraction methods to extract linguistic and acoustic features and feature selection methods to select most informative features; (3) Training different ML classifiers; and (4) Evaluating the performance of ML classifiers to investigate the impacts of language tasks, recording media, and modalities on dementia assessment. RESULTS: Our results show that (1) the ML classifiers trained with the picture description language task perform better than the classifiers trained with the story recall language task; (2) the data obtained from phone-based recordings improves the performance of ML classifiers compared to data obtained from web-based recordings; and (3) the ML classifiers trained with acoustic features perform better than the classifiers trained with linguistic features. CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates that we can improve the performance of automatic SLAMs as dementia assessment methods if we: (1) Use the picture description task to obtain participants' speech; (2) Collect participants' voices via phone-based recordings; and (3) Train ML classifiers using only acoustic features. Our proposed methodology will help future researchers to investigate the impacts of different factors on the performance of ML classifiers for assessing dementia.","2023-03-03","2025-02-19 20:47:13","2025-02-19 20:47:13","","45","","1","23","","BMC Med Inform Decis Mak","Performance of machine learning algorithms for dementia assessment","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36869377 PMCID: PMC9985301","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/8V23CFKT/Parsapoor Parsa et al. - 2023 - Performance of machine learning algorithms for dementia assessment impacts of language tasks, recor.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36869377","","Acoustic features; Aged; Algorithms; Alzheimer’s disease; Dementia; Humans; Language; Language assessment methods; Language impairments; Linguistic features; Linguistics; Machine learning; Machine Learning; Mild cognitive impairment; Speech assessment methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since AD significantly affects the content and acoustics of spontaneous speech, natural language processing, and machine learning provide promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. There has been a recent proliferation of classification models for AD, but these vary in the datasets used, model types and training and testing paradigms. In this study, we compare and contrast the performance of two common approaches for automatic AD detection from speech on the same, well-matched dataset, to determine the advantages of using domain knowledge vs. pre-trained transfer models. Methods: Audio recordings and corresponding manually-transcribed speech transcripts of a picture description task administered to 156 demographically matched older adults, 78 with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 78 cognitively intact (healthy) were classified using machine learning and natural language processing as ""AD"" or ""non-AD."" The audio was acoustically-enhanced, and post-processed to improve quality of the speech recording as well control for variation caused by recording conditions. Two approaches were used for classification of these speech samples: (1) using domain knowledge: extracting an extensive set of clinically relevant linguistic and acoustic features derived from speech and transcripts based on prior literature, and (2) using transfer-learning and leveraging large pre-trained machine learning models: using transcript-representations that are automatically derived from state-of-the-art pre-trained language models, by fine-tuning Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT)-based sequence classification models. Results: We compared the utility of speech transcript representations obtained from recent natural language processing models (i.e., BERT) to more clinically-interpretable language feature-based methods. Both the feature-based approaches and fine-tuned BERT models significantly outperformed the baseline linguistic model using a small set of linguistic features, demonstrating the importance of extensive linguistic information for detecting cognitive impairments relating to AD. We observed that fine-tuned BERT models numerically outperformed feature-based approaches on the AD detection task, but the difference was not statistically significant. Our main contribution is the observation that when tested on the same, demographically balanced dataset and tested on independent, unseen data, both domain knowledge and pretrained linguistic models have good predictive performance for detecting AD based on speech. It is notable that linguistic information alone is capable of achieving comparable, and even numerically better, performance than models including both acoustic and linguistic features here. We also try to shed light on the inner workings of the more black-box natural language processing model by performing an interpretability analysis, and find that attention weights reveal interesting patterns such as higher attribution to more important information content units in the picture description task, as well as pauses and filler words. Conclusion: This approach supports the value of well-performing machine learning and linguistically-focussed processing techniques to detect AD from speech and highlights the need to compare model performance on carefully balanced datasets, using consistent same training parameters and independent test datasets in order to determine the best performing predictive model.","2021","2025-02-25 13:43:45","2025-02-25 13:43:45","","635945","","","13","","Front Aging Neurosci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33986655 PMCID: PMC8110916","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/KKP4ZF5I/Balagopalan et al. - 2021 - Comparing Pre-trained and Feature-Based Models for Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Speech.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986655","","Alzheimer's disease; BERT; dementia detection; feature engineering; MMSE regression; transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
