Investigating alterations in speech and language patterns offers a promising path towards cost-effective and non-invasive early detection of AD on a large scale. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, have enabled powerful new possibilities for semantic text analysis. In this study, we leverage GPT-4 to extract five semantic features from transcripts of spontaneous patient speech. The features capture known symptoms of AD, but they are difficult to quantify effectively using traditional methods of computational linguistics. We demonstrate the clinical significance of these features and further validate one of them (“Word-Finding Difficulties”) against a proxy measure and human raters. When combined with established linguistic features and a Random Forest classifier, the GPT-derived features significantly improve the detection of AD. Our approach proves effective for both manually transcribed and automatically generated transcripts, representing a novel and impactful use of recent advancements in LLMs for AD speech analysis.",2025-01,2025-02-18 13:14:05,2025-02-18 13:14:11,2025-02-18 13:14:05,1850–1864,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Association for Computational Linguistics,"Abu Dhabi, UAE",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,ACLWeb,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/42EPWUCY/Heitz et al. - 2025 - Linguistic Features Extracted by GPT-4 Improve Alzheimer`s Disease Detection based on Spontaneous Sp.pdf,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"Rambow, Owen; Wanner, Leo; Apidianaki, Marianna; Al-Khalifa, Hend; Eugenio, Barbara Di; Schockaert, Steven",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,COLING 2025,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Unfortunately, datasets for AD assessment are often sparse and incomplete. In this work, we leverage the multiview nature of a small AD dataset, DementiaBank, to learn an embedding that captures different modes of cognitive impairment. We apply generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) to our dataset and demonstrate the added benefit of using multiview embeddings in two downstream tasks: identifying AD and predicting clinical scores. By including multiview embeddings, we obtain an F1 score of 0.82 in the classification task and a mean absolute error of 3.42 in the regression task.

Research has shown that alterations in speech, as well as linguistic and semantic deviations in spontaneous conversation detected using natural language processing, manifest early in AD prior to some other observed cognitive deficits. Recent studies show that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels serve as useful early biomarkers for identifying early AD, but CSF biomarkers are challenging to collect. A simpler alternative that has seen very rapid development is based on the use of plasma biomarkers as a blood draw is minimally invasive. Associating verbal and nonverbal characteristics from speech data with CSF and plasma biomarkers may open the door to less invasive, more efficient methods for early AD detection. We present SLaCAD, a new dataset to facilitate this process.

We compare different ASR systems in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) using a publicly available benchmark dataset of speech recordings of AD patients and controls. Furthermore, this study is the first to quantify how popular linguistic features change when replacing manual transcriptions with ASR output. This contributes to the understanding of linguistic features in the context of AD detection. Moreover, we investigate how ASR affects AD classification performance by implementing two popular approaches: A fine-tuned BERT model, and Random Forest on popular linguistic features.

As an alternative to fitting model parameters directly, we propose a novel method by which a Transformer DL model (GPT-2) pre-trained on general English text is paired with an artificially degraded version of itself (GPT-D), to compute the ratio between these two models' perplexities on language from cognitively healthy and impaired individuals. This technique approaches state-of-the-art performance on text data from a widely used “Cookie Theft” picture description task, and unlike established alternatives also generalizes well to spontaneous conversations. Furthermore, GPT-D generates text with characteristics known to be associated with AD, demonstrating the induction of dementia-related linguistic anomalies.

We divide linguistic features into non-overlapping subsets according to their modalities, and let neural networks learn low-dimensional representations that agree with each other. These representations are passed into a classifier network. All neural networks are optimized iteratively. In this paper, we also present two methods that improve the performance of CNs. We then present ablation studies to illustrate the effectiveness of modality division. To understand further what happens in CNs, we visualize the representations during training.

Language difficulties are a major problem in dementia as linguistic skills break down. Current methods do not provide robust tools to capture the true nature of language deficits in spontaneous speech. Early detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) from spontaneous speech overcomes the limitations of earlier approaches as it is less time consuming, can be done at home, and is relatively inexpensive. In this work, we re-implement the existing NLP methods, which used CNN-LSTM architectures and targeted features from conversational transcripts. Our work sheds light on why the accuracy of these models drops to 72.92% on the ADReSS dataset, whereas, they gave state of the art results on the DementiaBank dataset. Further, we build upon these language input-based recurrent neural networks by devising an end-to-end deep learning-based solution that performs a binary classification of Alzheimer's Dementia from the spontaneous speech of the patients. We utilize the ADReSS dataset for all our implementations and explore the deep learning-based methods of combining acoustic features into a common vector using recurrent units. Our approach of combining acoustic features using the Speech-GRU improves the accuracy by 2% in comparison to acoustic baselines. When further enriched by targeted features, the Speech-GRU performs better than acoustic baselines by 6.25%.

This Research Topic addresses this issue by exploring the use of speech characteristics for AD recognition using balanced data and shared tasks, such as those provided by the ADReSS Challenges (Luz et al., 2020(Luz et al., , 2021. These tasks have brought together groups working on this active area of research, providing the community with benchmarks for comparison of speech and language approaches to cognitive assessment. Reflecting the multidisciplinary character of the topic, the articles in this collection span three journals: Frontiers of Aging Neuroscience, Frontiers of Computer Science and Frontiers in Psychology.Most papers in this Reseach Topic target two main tasks: AD classification, for distinguishing individuals with AD from healthy controls, and cognitive test score regression, to infer the patient&#39;s Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score (Folstein et al., 1975). Of the twenty papers published in this collection, 14 used the ADReSS dataset (Luz et al., 2020), by itself or in combination with other data. The ADReSS dataset is a curated subset of DementiaBank&#39;s Pitt Corpus, matched for age and gender so as to minimise risk of bias in the prediction tasks. The data consist of audio recordings of picture descriptions elicited from participants using the Cookie Theft picture from the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (Becker et al., 1994;Goodglass et al., 2001), transcribed and annotated using the CHAT coding system (MacWhinney, 2021). The papers covered a variety of approaches and models.Antonsson, Lundolm Fors, Eckerstr&#246;m, and Kokkinakis aimed to distinguish progressive cognitive decline from stable cognitive impairment using semantic analysis of a discourse task. Support Vector Machine (SVM) models performed best (AUC=0.93) with both semantic verbal fluency scores and disfluency features from the discourse task. Discourse analysis revealed significantly greater use of unrelated speech in the progressive cognitive decline group compared with the stable group and healthy controls (HC).Clarke, Barrick, and Garrard examined the impact of five different speech tasks (picture description, conversation, overlearned narrative recall, procedural recall, novel narrative retelling) on classification of 50 participants: 25 HC, 13 mild AD, 12 MCI. Linguistic features (n=286) were automatically extracted from each task and used to train SVMs. Classification accuracy varied across tasks (62%-78% for HC vs AD+MCI, 59%-90% for HC vs AD, 50%-78% for HC vs MCI) as did which features were most important to the classification. Balagopalan, Eyre, Robin, Rudzicz and Novikova used linguistic and acoustic features derived from ADReSS speech and transcripts. They tuned a pretrained BERT model (Devlin et al., 2018) and compared its features to clinically-interpretable language features. The BERT model outperformed other features and achieved accuracy of 83.33% for AD classification. A ridget regressor with 25 pre-engineered features obtained root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.56 in MMSE prediction.Chlasta, and Wołk used VGGish, a pretrained a Tensorflow model for audio feature extraction and a custom raw waveform based convolutional neural neural (CNN), DemCNN, to model the acoustic characteristics of AD speech on the ADreSS dataset. DemCNN provided better results than VGGish (Hershey et al., 2017) and achieved an accuracy of 62.5% using only the acoustic information.De Looze, Dehsarvi, Crosby, Vourdanou, Coen, Lawlor and Reilly combined structural MRI, neuropsychological testing and conversational features to explore temporal characteristics of speech in a collaborative referencing task. They investigated associations with cognitive function and volumetry in brain areas known to be affected by MCI and AD. A linear mixed-effect model was built for data of 32 individuals to assess the predictive power of conversational speech features to classify clinical groups. They found that slower speech and slower turn-taking may provide useful markers for early detection of cognitive decline.Guo, Li, Roan, Pakhomov, and Cohen emphasized the importance of large normative datasets in training accurate and reliable machine learning models for dementia detection. They incorporated a new corpus of Cookie Theft picture descriptions (HC=839, NC=115) from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (Herd et al., 2014) to train a BERT model and demonstrated improved performance on the detection task compared with results of the model trained on the ADReSS data alone (82.1% vs 79.8, accuracy, and 92.3% vs 88.3% AUC).Haulcy and Glass investigated the use of i-vectors and x-vectors (Snyder et al., 2018), which are acoustic features originally devised for speaker identification, and linguistic features to tackle AD detection and MMSE prediction. The i-vectors and x-vectors were pre-trained on existing datasets unrelated to AD as well as in-domain data. Several classification and regression models were tested, yielding 85.4% accuracy in AD detection with SVM and Random Forests, and 4.56 RMSE with a gradient boosting regressor. Linguistic and acoustic features were modelled separately. The former yielded better performance. The authors speculate that the poor performance of i-vectors and x-vectors was due to in-and out-of-domain training data mismatch.Jonell, Mo&#235;ll , H&#229;kansson , Henter, Kucherenko , Mikheeva, Hagman, Holleman, Kivipelto, Kjellstr&#246;m, Gustafson and Beskow proposed a multimodal analysis of patient behavior to improve early detection of dementia. Their system captured data from clinical interviews using nine different sensor devices which recorded speech, language, facial gestures, motor signs, gaze, pupil dilation, heart rate variability and thermal emission. This information was gathered from 25 patients with AD and later combined with brain scans, psychological tests, speech therapist assessments and other clinical data. They found that multimodality, in combination with the more established biomarkers, improves clinical discrimination.Laguarta and Subirana present an approach to the identification of different diseases which combines multiple biomarkers (features), including vocal cords, sentiment, lung and respiratory tract, among others. The authors employed transfer learning from other (non-AD) audio datasets to learn these features. The resulting model achieved up to 93% accuracy on the ADReSS dataset. Interestingly, the respiratory tract features, which were previously used in the detection of COVID-19 from a cough dataset, also proved helpful in AD detection.Lindsay, Tr&#246;ger and K&#246;nig investigated spontaneous speech of 78 HC and 76 AD individuals in English and French, proposing a multilingual model. Task-specific, semantic, syntactic and paralinguistic features were analysed. They found that language features, excluding task specific features, represent &quot;generalisable&quot; signs for cognitive language impairment in AD, outperforming all other feature sets. Semantic features were the most generalizable, with paralinguistic features showing no overlap between languages.The work of Mahajan and Baths tested several acoustic and linguistic models, comparing their performance on ADReSS and a larger subset of DementiaBank. They employed a deep learning bimodal model to combine these features. For linguistic models, accuracy was lower on ADReSS than on DementiaBank (73% vs 88%). The authors attribute this to the smaller size of ADReSS and to overfitting in DementiaBank due to repeated samples from the same participant. Although the best linguistic model performed similarly to the bimodal learner, the authors suggest a number of possible improvements.Martinc, Haider, Pollak and Luz presented a multimodal approach to AD detection using ADreSS data. The Active Data Representation method (Haider et al., 2020) was used for fusion of acoustic and textual features at sentence and word level, along with temporal aspects of linguistic features. They achieved an accuracy of 93.75% through late fusion of acoustic, text and temporal models.Meghanani, Anoop, and Ramakrishnan compared two approaches to the challenge tasks based on use of the non-automatic, hand-created transcripts. Both methods relied on the extraction of n-grams of varying lengths (n=2,3,4,5) from the transcripts. The first method employed CNNs with a single convolutional layer in which the kernel size was adapted to the n-gram size. The second method used the fastText model with bigrams and trigrams. The fastText models outperformed the CNN models, achieving 83.3% accuracy for classification and RMSE of 4.87 for prediction of MMSE scores.Millington and Luz approached the data representation problem in the ADReSS dataset by converting its text transcriptions into word co-occurrence graphs and computing several graph structure metrics. They found that AD graphs have lower heterogeneity and centralization, but higher edge density. These metrics were used as input features to standard machine learning classifiers and regressors. A graph embedding metric was tested for comparison. Graph metrics outperformed graph embedding, achieving 66.7% accuracy in classification, and 5.67 RMSE in MMSE regression.Nasreen, Rohanian, Hough and Purver investigated the role of conversational features such as dysfluencies, pauses, overlaps and other interactional elements in AD detection. They used the Carolinas Conversations Collection (Pope and Davis, 2011) to create classification models based on those features. The combination of dysfluency and interactional features resulted in a classification accuracy of 90%. These findings in conversational speech seem to agree with the findings from other papers in this Research Topic, which highlighted the importance of pauses and dysfluency in detecting AD in the ADReSS monologue data.Parvin, Mohammadian, Amani-Shalamzari, Bayati and Tazesh performed a randomised controlled clinical trial to investigate the effects of dual-task training on 26 patients with AD. Patients performed physical, cognitive and mental assessments and had their brain oscillations measured pre-and post-intervention, which consisted of a 12-week visual training program. The trained group showed significant improvements in cognitive function, mood and fitness. This was associated with a significant positive change in brain oscillation.Sadeghian, Schaffer, and Zahorian examined the potential of an almost fully automated system for AD detection. Rather than using DementiaBank, they collected 72 new samples (26 AD, 46 HC) with higher quality audio. ASR was performed on data with pauses removed using voice activity detection. From this, they extracted 236 textual features and then used a genetic algorithm as well as a Multi-Layer Perceptron to identify the 10 most useful features, achieving 94% accuracy in detection. Shah Sawalha, Tasnim, Qi, Stroulia and Greiner used speech samples from the DementiaBank database for binary classification and MMSE regression. Although they developed models that combined acoustic and language-based features, their best performing model for binary classification used language-based features only with a regularized logistic regression, achieving 85.4% accuracy on a hold-out test set. A more reduced set of language features was their best performing model for the regression task, with an RMSE of 5.62.Yuan, Cai, Bian, Ye, and Church presented a method for encoding filled and unfilled pauses in transcripts to fine tune the training of language models using BERT and ERNIE. The accuracy of dementia detection improved to 89.6% (with ERNIE). Compared with controls, the individuals with dementia vocalised filled pause um much less frequently than uh, and their language samples included more pauses.Zhu, Liang, Batsis, and Roth used a transfer learning technique to fine-tuning the last layers of a pretrained model with customized layers for AD detection. The MobileNet and YAMNet network architectures were employed for this. They then used speech and text versions of BERT, individually and in combination for the same task. The text models outperformed the speech models, with the version based on pre-training with the longest input frame achieving 89.58% accuracy. The models which combined audio and speech data generally performed better than the models separately.",2021-10-21,2025-02-18 20:21:08,2025-02-18 20:21:08,2025-02-18 20:21:08,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,Front.

Methods: A systematic literature search was performed from Jan 2015 up to May 2020 using ScienceDirect, PubMed and DBLP. Articles were screened by title, abstract and full text as needed. A manual complementary search among the references of the included papers was also performed. Inclusion criteria and search strategies were defined a priori. Results: We were able: to identify the main resources that can support the development of decision support systems for AD, to list speech features that are correlated with the linguistic and acoustic footprint of the disease, to recognize the data models that can provide robust results and to observe the performance indicators that were reported. Discussion: A computational system with the adequate elements combination, based on the identified best-practices, can point to a whole new diagnostic approach, leading to better insights about AD symptoms and its disease patterns, creating conditions to promote a longer life span as well as an improvement in patient quality of life.

Picture description tasks are routinely used to monitor language impairment in AD. Due to the high amount of manual resources needed for an in-depth analysis of thereby-produced spontaneous speech, advanced natural language processing (NLP) combined with machine learning (ML) represents a promising opportunity. In this applied research field though, NLP and ML methodology do not necessarily ensure robust clinically actionable insights into cognitive language impairment in AD and additional precautions must be taken to ensure clinical-validity and generalizability of results. In this study, we add generalizability through multilingual feature statistics to computational approaches for the detection of language impairment in AD. We include 154 participants (78 healthy subjects, 76 patients with AD) from two different languages (106 English speaking and 47 French speaking). Each participant completed a picture description task, in addition to a battery of neuropsychological tests. Each response was recorded and manually transcribed. From this, task-specific, semantic, syntactic and paralinguistic features are extracted using NLP resources. Using inferential statistics, we determined language features, excluding task specific features, that are significant in both languages and therefore represent “generalizable” signs for cognitive language impairment in AD. In a second step, we evaluated all features as well as the generalizable ones for English, French and both languages in a binary discrimination ML scenario (AD vs. healthy) using a variety of classifiers. The generalizable language feature set outperforms the all language feature set in English, French and the multilingual scenarios. Semantic features are the most generalizable while paralinguistic features show no overlap between languages. The multilingual model shows an equal distribution of error in both English and French. By leveraging multilingual statistics combined with a theory-driven approach, we identify AD-related language impairment that generalizes beyond a single corpus or language to model language impairment as a clinically-relevant cognitive symptom. We find a primary impairment in semantics in addition to mild syntactic impairment, possibly confounded by additional impaired cognitive functions.</p>",2021-05-19,2025-02-18 20:22:44,2025-02-18 20:22:44,2025-02-18 20:22:44,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,13,Unknown,Front.

However, there has been a focus on the Cookie Theft picture description task, which has been criticized. Fifty participants were recruited – 25 healthy controls (HC), 25 mild AD or MCI (AD+MCI) – and these completed five connected speech tasks: picture description, a conversational map reading task, recall of an overlearned narrative, procedural recall and narration of a wordless picture book.

Performance varied, with accuracy for HC vs. AD+MCI classification ranging from 62% using picture book narration to 78% using overlearned narrative features. This study shows that, importantly, the conditions of the speech task have an impact on the discourse produced, which influences accuracy in detection of AD beyond the length of the sample.

Despite nationwide efforts for timely diagnosis of patients with ADRD, >50 % of them are not diagnosed and unaware of their disease. To address this challenge, we developed ADscreen, an innovative speech-processing based ADRD screening algorithm for the protective identification of patients with ADRD. ADscreen consists of five major components: (i) noise reduction for reducing background noises from the audio-recorded patient speech, (ii) modeling the patient's ability in phonetic motor planning using acoustic parameters of the patient's voice, (iii) modeling the patient's ability in semantic and syntactic levels of language organization using linguistic parameters of the patient speech, (iv) extracting vocal and semantic psycholinguistic cues from the patient speech, and (v) building and evaluating the screening algorithm. To identify important speech parameters (features) associated with ADRD, we used the Joint Mutual Information Maximization (JMIM), an effective feature selection method for high dimensional, small sample size datasets. Modeling the relationship between speech parameters and the outcome variable (presence/absence of ADRD) was conducted using three different machine learning (ML) architectures with the capability of joining informative acoustic and linguistic with contextual word embedding vectors obtained from the DistilBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We evaluated the performance of the ADscreen on an audio-recorded patients' speech (verbal description) for the Cookie-Theft picture description task, which is publicly available in the dementia databank. The joint fusion of acoustic and linguistic parameters with contextual word embedding vectors of DistilBERT achieved F1-score = 84.64 (standard deviation [std] = ±3.58) and AUC-ROC = 92.53 (std = ±3.34) for training dataset, and F1-score = 89.55 and AUC-ROC = 93.89 for the test dataset.

Detecting diagnostic biomarkers that are noninvasive and cost-effective is of great value not only for clinical assessments and diagnostics but also for research purposes. Several previous studies have investigated AD diagnosis via the acoustic, lexical, syntactic, and semantic aspects of speech and language. Other studies include approaches from conversation analysis that look at more interactional aspects, showing that disfluencies such as fillers and repairs, and purely nonverbal features such as inter-speaker silence, can be key features of AD conversations. These kinds of features, if useful for diagnosis, may have many advantages: They are simple to extract and relatively language-, topic-, and task-independent. This study aims to quantify the role and contribution of these features of interaction structure in predicting whether a dialogue participant has AD. We used a subset of the Carolinas Conversation Collection dataset of patients with AD at moderate stage within the age range 60–89 and similar-aged non-AD patients with other health conditions. Our feature analysis comprised two sets: <italic>disfluency</italic> features, including indicators such as self-repairs and fillers, and <italic>interactional</italic> features, including overlaps, turn-taking behavior, and distributions of different types of silence both within patient speech and between patient and interviewer speech. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between AD and non-AD groups for several disfluency features (edit terms, verbatim repeats, and substitutions) and interactional features (lapses, gaps, attributable silences, turn switches per minute, standardized phonation time, and turn length). For the classification of AD patient conversations vs. non-AD patient conversations, we achieved 83% accuracy with disfluency features, 83% accuracy with interactional features, and an overall accuracy of 90% when combining both feature sets using support vector machine classifiers. The discriminative power of these features, perhaps combined with more conventional linguistic features, therefore shows potential for integration into noninvasive clinical assessments for AD at advanced stages.</p>",2021-06-18,2025-02-19 08:49:40,2025-02-19 08:49:40,2025-02-19 08:49:40,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,3,Unknown,Front.

While previous studies have employed acoustic (speech) features for characterisation of Alzheimer's dementia, these studies focused on a few common prosodic features, often in combination with lexical and syntactic features which require transcription. We present a detailed study of the predictive value of purely acoustic features automatically extracted from spontaneous speech for Alzheimer's dementia detection, from a computational paralinguistics perspective. The effectiveness of several state-of-the-art paralinguistic feature sets for Alzheimer's detection were assessed on a balanced sample of DementiaBank's Pitt spontaneous speech dataset, with patients matched by gender and age. The feature sets assessed were the extended Geneva minimalistic acoustic parameter set (eGeMAPS), the emobase feature set, the ComParE 2013 feature set, and new Multi-Resolution Cochleagram (MRCG) features. Furthermore, we introduce a new active data representation (ADR) method for feature extraction in Alzheimer's dementia recognition. Results show that classification models based solely on acoustic speech features extracted through our ADR method can achieve accuracy levels comparable to those achieved by models that employ higher-level language features. Analysis of the results suggests that all feature sets contribute information not captured by other feature sets. We show that while the eGeMAPS feature set provides slightly better accuracy than other feature sets individually (71.34%), “hard fusion” of feature sets improves accuracy to 78.70%.",2020-02,2025-02-19 09:11:10,2025-02-19 09:11:10,2025-02-19 09:11:10,272-281,Unknown,2,14,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,IEEE Xplore,Unknown,Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing,Unknown,/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/U5SD7B7H/Haider et al. - 2020 - An Assessment of Paralinguistic Acoustic Features for Detection of Alzheimer's Dementia in Spontaneo.pdf,Unknown,Unknown,Acoustics; Affective computing; Alzheimer; Alzheimer's disease; cognitive decline detection; cognitive imp-airment detection; dementia; Feature extraction; Semantics; social signal processing; Task analysis,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

The World Health Organisation reports an alarming 55 million individuals living with dementia worldwide, with an additional 10 million new cases identified annually. Dementia, a group of cognitive disorders affecting fundamental abilities like thinking, remembering, and reasoning, is primarily attributed to the destruction of brain cells, exerting a profound impact on brain function. Alzheimer’s disease, representing 60-80 percent of all dementia cases, is a progressive neurological condition, while vascular dementia, the second most prevalent form, results from microscopic brain hemorrhages and artery blockages. The progression of Alzheimer’s disease disrupts memory and cognitive functions. This study aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse by comparing the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in forecasting dementia incidence over two years against established models. The objective is to identify the most effective analytical techniques and determine the optimal number of predictive components for such forecasts.

It is also the main cause of dementia, which affects memory, thinking skills, and mental abilities. Nowadays, researchers have moved their interest towards AD detection from spontaneous speech, since it constitutes a time-effective procedure. However, existing state-of-the-art works proposing multimodal approaches do not take into consideration the inter- and intra-modal interactions and propose early and late fusion approaches. To tackle these limitations, we propose deep neural networks, which can be trained in an end-to-end trainable way and capture the inter- and intra-modal interactions. Firstly, each audio file is converted to an image consisting of three channels, i.e., log-Mel spectrogram, delta, and delta-delta. Next, each transcript is passed through a BERT model followed by a gated self-attention layer. Similarly, each image is passed through a Swin Transformer followed by an independent gated self-attention layer. Acoustic features are extracted also from each audio file. Finally, the representation vectors from the different modalities are fed to a tensor fusion layer for capturing the inter-modal interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on the ADReSS Challenge dataset indicate that our introduced approaches obtain valuable advantages over existing research initiatives reaching Accuracy and F1-score up to 86.25% and 85.48% respectively.",2022-09,2025-02-24 13:04:05,2025-02-24 13:04:05,2025-02-24 13:04:05,1-5,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,IEEE Xplore,Unknown,ISSN: 2641-3604,Unknown,/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/VDEI7T8Z/Ilias et al. - 2022 - A Multimodal Approach for Dementia Detection from Spontaneous Speech with Tensor Fusion Layer.pdf; /Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/DEAYZVMA/9926818.html,Unknown,Unknown,Alzheimer's Disease; BERT; Deep learning; Dementia; Feature extraction; Gated Self-Attention; log-Mel spectrogram; Logic gates; Neural networks; Neurological diseases; Swin Transformer; Tensor Fusion Layer; Tensors; Transformers,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2022 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI),Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Language deficit is one of the common signs that appear in the early stage of mild Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, using natural language processing and related machine learning algorithms for AD diagnosis using patients’ speech recordings has drawn more attention in recent years. In this study, three approaches are proposed to extract features through speech recording in this model: (1) using fine-tuning pre-trained encoder model (BERT) for transcripts from automatic transcription, (2) hand-crafted linguistic features for transcripts from automatic transcription, and (3) selected acoustic features for denoised speech recordings. The three designed approaches are applied to three tasks: AD diagnosis, MMSE score prediction, and cognitive decline inference. The approach using BERT yields the best performance in all three challenge tasks based on cross-validation results using the training dataset. Specifically, in the AD diagnosis task, 5-fold cross-validation using encoded features based on transcripts generated from Deep Speech yields an average classification accuracy of 97.18%. In the MMSE score prediction task, 5-fold cross-validation using BERT encoded features based on transcripts generated from Deep Speech yields an average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.76. In the cognitive decline inference task, the leave-one-out cross-validation using BERT encoded features based on transcripts generated from Sphinx or Deep Speech yields an average classification accuracy of 100%. The analyses suggest that the combination of automatic transcription and BERT may produce a significant performance in AD related detection and prediction problems.",2021-09,2025-02-24 13:04:07,2025-02-24 13:04:07,2025-02-24 13:04:07,39-43,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,IEEE Xplore,Unknown,ISSN: 2642-6471,Unknown,/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/KIN9LR4J/Liu et al. - 2021 - Automatic Diagnosis and Prediction of Cognitive Decline Associated with Alzheimer’s Dementia through.pdf; /Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/799JR92T/9576784.html,Unknown,Unknown,Alzheimer’s dementia; automatic speech recognition; Bit error rate; detection; Feature extraction; Linguistics; Machine learning algorithms; Natural language processing; prediction; Reliability; Training,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA),Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative pathology that develops years prior to clinical manifestations and typically preceded by prodromal stages such as Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Currently, the manual diagnostic procedures of both types are time consuming, following certain clinical criteria and neuropsychological examinations. Our study aims to establish state-of-the-art performance in the automatic identification of different dementia etiologies, including AD, MCI, and Possible AD (PoAD), and to determine whether patients with initial cognitive declines exhibit language deficits through the analysis of language samples deduced with the cookie theft picture description task. Data was derived from the cookie theft picture corpus of DementiaBank, from which all language samples of the identified etiologies were used, with a random subsampling technique that handles the skewness of the classes. Several original lexical and syntactic (i.e., lexicosyntactic) features were introduced and used alongside previously established lexicosyntactics to train machine learning (ML) classifiers against these etiologies. Further, a statistical analysis was conducted to uncover the deficiency across these etiologies. Our models resulted in benchmarks for differentiating all the identified classes with accuracies ranging between 95 to 98% and corresponding F1 values falling between 94 and 98%. The statistical analysis of our lexicosyntactic biomarkers shows that linguistic deviations are associated with prodromal as well as advanced neurodegenerative pathologies, being greatly impacted as cognitive decline increases and suggesting that language biomarkers may aid the early diagnosis of these pathologies.",2020,2025-02-24 13:04:10,2025-02-24 13:04:10,2025-02-24 13:04:10,193856-193873,Unknown,Unknown,8,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,IEEE Xplore,Unknown,Conference Name: IEEE Access,Unknown,/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/6XLIJ7ZS/Alkenani et al. - 2020 - Predicting Prodromal Dementia Using Linguistic Patterns and Deficits.pdf; /Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/QARN7S2W/9218925.html,Unknown,Unknown,Acoustics; Alzheimer’s disease; clinical diagnosis; cognitive decline; Dementia; Feature extraction; feature selection; Linguistics; machine learning; neurolinguistics; prediction; prodromal dementia; Support vector machines; Syntactics; Task analysis,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

However, most of them simply take the speech data from a subject participating in a task (e.g., picture description) as a whole audio sequence, and lack considerations on separate utterances that may be related to different topics in the picture and are of different importance for discriminating AD patients from healthy controls. To this end, this letter proposes an AD detection method with topic modeling for utterances composed of audio words. First, an audio word discovery algorithm using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is designed to tokenize speech data without relying on text transcriptions. Then, a topic model is built that assigns each utterance a topic label in an unsupervised way. Finally, an Audio-Word HuBERT (AW-HuBERT) model integrating utterance-level topic labels is constructed for AD detection. This model is pretrained by training the existing HuBERT model with audio word sequences. The final decision for a recording is made by the weighted sum of utterance-level classification possibilities, and topic-dependent Area-Under-Curve (AUC) values are used as the weights.

It is a slow progressive disease affecting the brain cells. This affects the cognitive abilities of people and their daily activities. During the course of the disease, memory gets brutally affected too. Working as well as long-term declarative memory deteriorates in AD patients. Due to this deterioration of the memory, AD patients tend to show a decline in their communicative skills as well. This decline is reflected in their speech. AD patients usually have poor grammar along with very low coherent ideas. Also, they tend to repeat the words very often and hence become unclear on the message they are trying to convey. As the disease progresses, the speech is completely impaired, and the patients are left to sing or utter words that are totally out of context. Stopwords are the words that are most commonly used in language and it is often hypothesized that AD patients use them much often as compared to Control Normal (CN) subjects. It is seen that due to the degeneration of brain cells in AD patients, they have a tendency to use a lot of stopwords to fill their perplexities in their statements.

Specifically, we first utilize an adversarial attack approach by adding the perturbation to the speech pauses of the testing samples, aiming to reduce the confidence levels of the detection model. Then, we apply an adversarial training approach to evaluate the impact of the perturbation in training samples on the detection model. We examine the interpretability from the perspectives of model accuracy, pause context, and pause length. We found that some pauses are more sensitive to dementia than other pauses from the model’s perspective, e.g., speech pauses near to the verb “is”.

Early detection and intervention are the most effective prevention methods currently. Compared with traditional detection methods such as traditional scale tests, electroencephalograms, and magnetic resonance imaging, speech analysis is more convenient for automatic large-scale Alzheimer's disease detection and has attracted extensive attention from researchers. In particular, deep learning-based speech analysis and language processing techniques for Alzheimer's disease detection have been studied and achieved impressive results. METHODS: To integrate the latest research progresses, hundreds of relevant papers from ACM, DBLP, IEEE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science electronic databases, and other sources were retrieved.

However, current diagnostic techniques are not designed for frequent mass screening, delaying therapeutic intervention and worsening prognoses. To be able to detect AD at an early stage, ideally at a pre-clinical stage, speech analysis emerges as a simple low-cost non-invasive procedure. OBJECTIVES: In this work it is our objective to do a systematic review about speech-based detection and classification of Alzheimer's Disease with the purpose of identifying the most effective algorithms and best practices. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed from Jan 2015 up to May 2020 using ScienceDirect, PubMed and DBLP. Articles were screened by title, abstract and full text as needed. A manual complementary search among the references of the included papers was also performed. Inclusion criteria and search strategies were defined a priori. RESULTS: We were able: to identify the main resources that can support the development of decision support systems for AD, to list speech features that are correlated with the linguistic and acoustic footprint of the disease, to recognize the data models that can provide robust results and to observe the performance indicators that were reported. DISCUSSION: A computational system with the adequate elements combination, based on the identified best-practices, can point to a whole new diagnostic approach, leading to better insights about AD symptoms and its disease patterns, creating conditions to promote a longer life span as well as an improvement in patient quality of life. The clinically relevant results that were identified can be used to establish a reference system and help to define research guidelines for future developments.",2022-01-11,2025-02-19 20:38:07,2025-02-19 20:38:07,Unknown,27,Unknown,1,9,Unknown,Bioengineering (Basel),Speech- and Language-Based Classification of Alzheimer's Disease,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,eng,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,PubMed,Unknown,PMID: 35049736 PMCID: PMC8772820,Unknown,/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/EK3Z9DQ7/Vigo et al. - 2022 - Speech- and Language-Based Classification of Alzheimer's Disease A Systematic Review.pdf; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35049736,Unknown,Alzheimer’s disease (AD); classification; features; machine learning (ML); mild cognitive impairment (MCI); speech,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

To test for specificity, we replicated the analyses on Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. RESULTS: Relative to controls, ADD (but not PD) patients exhibited significant differences in both measures.

This study tests an automated analysis of natural speech as an inexpensive, non-invasive screening tool for AD co-pathology in biologically-confirmed cohorts of LBD patients with AD co-pathology (SYN + AD) and without (SYN-AD). METHODS: We analyzed lexical-semantic and acoustic features of picture descriptions using automated methods in 22 SYN + AD and 38 SYN-AD patients stratified using AD CSF biomarkers or autopsy diagnosis. Speech markers of AD co-pathology were identified using best subset regression, and their diagnostic discrimination was tested using receiver operating characteristic. ANCOVAs compared measures between groups covarying for demographic differences and cognitive disease severity. We tested relations with CSF tau levels, and compared speech measures between PDD and DLB clinical disorders in the same cohort. RESULTS: Age of acquisition of nouns (p = 0.034, |d| = 0.77) and lexical density (p = 0.0064, |d| = 0.72) were reduced in SYN + AD, and together showed excellent discrimination for SYN + AD vs. SYN-AD (95% sensitivity, 66% specificity; AUC = 0.82). Lower lexical density was related to higher CSF t-Tau levels (R = -0.41, p = 0.0021). Clinically-diagnosed PDD vs. DLB did not differ on any speech features. CONCLUSION: AD co-pathology may result in a deviant natural speech profile in LBD characterized by specific lexical-semantic impairments, not detectable by clinical disorder diagnosis.

This study explores significant standalone speech features to recognize dementia. The primary contribution of this work is to identify a compact set of speech features that aid in the dementia recognition process. The secondary contribution is to leverage machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models for the recognition task.

In this work, we show for the first time that GPT-3 can be utilized to predict dementia from spontaneous speech. Specifically, we leverage the vast semantic knowledge encoded in the GPT-3 model to generate text embedding, a vector representation of the transcribed text from speech, that captures the semantic meaning of the input. We demonstrate that the text embedding can be reliably used to (1) distinguish individuals with AD from healthy controls, and (2) infer the subject's cognitive testing score, both solely based on speech data. We further show that text embedding considerably outperforms the conventional acoustic feature-based approach and even performs competitively with prevailing fine-tuned models.

Referential communication tasks (RCTs) are used to examine a speaker's capability to select and verbally code the characteristics of an object in interactive conversation. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used contextualized word representations from Natural language processing (NLP) to evaluate how well RCTs are able to distinguish between people with AD and cognitively healthy older adults. METHODS: We adapted machine learning techniques to analyze manually transcribed speech transcripts in an RCT from 28 older adults, including 12 with AD and 16 cognitively healthy older adults. Two approaches were applied to classify these speech transcript samples: 1) using clinically relevant linguistic features, 2) using machine learned representations derived by a state-of-art pretrained NLP transfer learning model, Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT) based classification model. RESULTS: The results demonstrated the superior performance of AD detection using a designed transfer learning NLP algorithm. Moreover, the analysis showed that transcripts of a single image yielded high accuracies in AD detection. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that RCT may be useful as a diagnostic tool for AD, and that the task can be simplified to a subset of images without significant sacrifice to diagnostic accuracy, which can make RCT an easier and more practical tool for AD diagnosis.

Specifically, we first utilize an adversarial attack approach by adding the perturbation to the speech pauses of the testing samples, aiming to reduce the confidence levels of the detection model. Then, we apply an adversarial training approach to evaluate the impact of the perturbation in training samples on the detection model. We examine the interpretability from the perspectives of model accuracy, pause context, and pause length. We found that some pauses are more sensitive to dementia than other pauses from the model's perspective, e.g., speech pauses near to the verb ""is"".

However, the speech dataset available for this research is extremely limited because the collection process of speech and baseline data from patients with dementia in clinical settings is expensive. In this paper, we study the spontaneous speech dataset from a recent ADReSS challenge, a Cookie Theft Picture (CTP) dataset with balanced groups of participants in age, gender, and cognitive status. We explore state-of-the-art deep transfer learning techniques from image, audio, speech, and language domains. We envision that one advantage of transfer learning is to eliminate the design of handcrafted features based on the tasks and datasets. Transfer learning further mitigates the limited dementia-relevant speech data problem by inheriting knowledge from similar but much larger datasets. Specifically, we built a variety of transfer learning models using commonly employed MobileNet (image), YAMNet (audio), Mockingjay (speech), and BERT (text) models. Results indicated that the transfer learning models of text data showed significantly better performance than those of audio data. Performance gains of the text models may be due to the high similarity between the pre-training text dataset and the CTP text dataset. Our multi-modal transfer learning introduced a slight improvement in accuracy, demonstrating that audio and text data provide limited complementary information. Multi-task transfer learning resulted in limited improvements in classification and a negative impact in regression. By analyzing the meaning behind the AD/non-AD labels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, we observed that the inconsistency between labels and scores could limit the performance of the multi-task learning, especially when the outputs of the single-task models are highly consistent with the corresponding labels/scores. In sum, we conducted a large comparative analysis of varying transfer learning models focusing less on model customization but more on pre-trained models and pre-training datasets.

We determined the aspects of speech and language that exhibited significant longitudinal change over 18 months. Nine acoustic and linguistic measures were combined to create a novel composite score. The speech composite exhibited significant correlations with primary and secondary clinical endpoints and a similar effect size for detecting longitudinal change.

This study delves into the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques by leveraging paralinguistic features extracted directly from a brief spontaneous speech (SS) protocol. We aimed to explore the capability of ML techniques to discriminate between different degrees of cognitive impairment based on SS. Furthermore, for the first time, this study investigates the relationship between paralinguistic features from SS and cognitive function within the AD spectrum. METHODS: Physical-acoustic features were extracted from voice recordings of patients evaluated in a memory unit who underwent a SS protocol. We implemented several ML models evaluated via cross-validation to identify individuals without cognitive impairment (subjective cognitive decline, SCD), with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and with dementia due to AD (ADD). In addition, we established models capable of predicting cognitive domain performance based on a comprehensive neuropsychological battery from Fundació Ace (NBACE) using SS-derived information. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that, based on a paralinguistic analysis of sound, it is possible to identify individuals with ADD (F1 = 0.92) and MCI (F1 = 0.84). Furthermore, our models, based on physical acoustic information, exhibited correlations greater than 0.5 for predicting the cognitive domains of attention, memory, executive functions, language, and visuospatial ability. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show the potential of a brief and cost-effective SS protocol in distinguishing between different degrees of cognitive impairment and forecasting performance in cognitive domains commonly affected within the AD spectrum. Our results demonstrate a high correspondence with protocols traditionally used to assess cognitive function. Overall, it opens up novel prospects for developing screening tools and remote disease monitoring.",2024-02-02,2025-02-19 20:41:15,2025-02-19 20:41:15,Unknown,26,Unknown,1,16,Unknown,Alzheimers Res Ther,Unveiling the sound of the cognitive status,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,eng,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,PubMed,Unknown,PMID: 38308366 PMCID: PMC10835990,Unknown,/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/MEJWDG97/García-Gutiérrez et al. - 2024 - Unveiling the sound of the cognitive status Machine Learning-based speech analysis in the Alzheimer.pdf; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38308366,Unknown,Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer’s disease; Automated pattern recognition; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression; Early diagnosis; Humans; Machine Learning; Mild cognitive impairment; Neuropsychological tests; Neuropsychological Tests; Speech; Speech acoustics,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Significant differences in speech have previously been found by comparing the press conference transcripts of President Bush and President Reagan, who was later diagnosed with AD. OBJECTIVE: In the current study, we explored whether the patterns previously established in the single AD-healthy control (HC) participant pair apply to a larger group of individuals who later receive AD diagnosis. METHODS: We replicated previous methods on two larger corpora of longitudinal spontaneous speech samples of public figures, consisting of 10 and 9 AD-HC participant pairs. As we failed to find generalizable patterns of language change using previous methodology, we proposed alternative methods for data analysis, investigating the benefits of using different language features and their change with age, and compiling the single features into aggregate scores. RESULTS: The single features that showed the strongest results were moving average type:token ratio (MATTR) and pronoun-related features. The aggregate scores performed better than the single features, with lexical diversity capturing a similar change in two-thirds of the participants. CONCLUSION: Capturing universal patterns of language change prior to AD can be challenging, but the decline in lexical diversity and changes in MATTR and pronoun-related features act as promising measures that reflect the cognitive changes in many participants.",2023,2025-02-19 20:41:21,2025-02-19 20:41:21,Unknown,547-564,Unknown,2,92,Unknown,J Alzheimers Dis,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,eng,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,PubMed,Unknown,PMID: 36776053,Unknown,Unknown,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36776053,Unknown,Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer’s disease; biomarker; cognitive dysfunction; Cognitive Dysfunction; dementia; early diagnosis; Humans; language; Language; Language Disorders; medical informatics; natural language processing; speech; Speech,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

In this paper, we explore the voice commands using a Voice-Assistant System (VAS), i.e., Amazon Alexa, from 40 older adults who were either Healthy Control (HC) participants or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) participants, age 65 or older. We evaluated the data collected from voice commands, cognitive assessments, and interviews and surveys using a structured protocol. We extracted 163 unique command-relevant features from each participant's use of the VAS. We then built machine-learning models including 1-layer/2-layer neural networks, support vector machines, decision tree, and random forest, for classification and comparison with standard cognitive assessment scores, e.g., Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Our classification models using fusion features achieved an accuracy of 68%, and our regression model resulted in a Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) score of 3.53. Our Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models using selected features achieved higher classification accuracy 80-90%. Finally, we analyzed the contribution of each feature set to the model output, thus revealing the commands and features most useful in inferring the participants' cognitive status.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of Science for articles published in English between 2013 and 2019. We performed a systematic literature review to answer 5 key questions: (1) What were the characteristics of participant groups? (2) What language data were collected? (3) What features of speech and language were the most informative? (4) What methods were used to classify between groups? (5) What classification performance was achieved? RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified 33 eligible studies and 5 main findings: participants' demographic variables (especially age ) were often unbalanced between AD and control group; spontaneous speech data were collected most often; informative language features were related to word retrieval and semantic, syntactic, and acoustic impairment; neural nets, support vector machines, and decision trees performed well in AD detection, and support vector machines and decision trees performed well in decline detection; and average classification accuracy was 89% in AD and 82% in mild cognitive impairment detection versus healthy control groups.

Annual International Conference,Unknown,2694-0604,10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871204,Unknown,"As the most common neurodegenerative disease among older adults, Alzheimer's disease (AD) would lead to loss of memory, impaired language and judgment, gait disorders, and other cognitive deficits severe enough to interfere with daily activities and significantly diminish quality of life. Recent research has shown promising results in automatic AD diagnosis via speech, leveraging the advances of deep learning in the audio domain. However, most existing studies rely on a centralized learning framework which requires subjects' voice data to be gathered to a central server, raising severe privacy concerns. To resolve this, in this paper, we propose the first federated-learning-based approach for achieving automatic AD diagnosis via spontaneous speech analysis while ensuring the subjects' data privacy. Extensive experiments under various federated learning settings on the ADReSS challenge dataset show that the proposed model can achieve high accuracy for AD detection while achieving privacy preservation. To ensure fairness of the model performance across clients in federated settings, we further deploy fair aggregation mechanisms, particularly q-FEDAvg and q-FEDSgd, which greatly reduces the algorithmic biases due to the data heterogeneity among the clients.

OBJECTIVE: Summarize the state-of-the-art machine learning-based approaches for dementia prediction, focusing on non-invasive methods, as the burden on the patients is lower. Specifically, the analysis of gait and speech performance can offer insights into cognitive health through clinically cost-effective screening methods. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The search was performed on three electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed) to identify the relevant studies published between 2017 to 2022. A total of 40 papers were selected for review. RESULTS: The most common machine learning methods employed were support vector machine followed by deep learning. Studies suggested the use of multimodal approaches as they can provide comprehensive and better prediction performance. Deep learning application in gait studies is still in the early stages as few studies have applied it. Moreover, including features of whole body movement contribute to better classification accuracy.

The participants underwent amyloid-β positron emission tomography scans, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and comprehensive neuropsychological testing. Participants' speech data from a picture description task were examined. A total of 15 linguistic features were analyzed to classify groups and predict cognitive performance. RESULTS: We found notable linguistic differences between the early-AD and NC groups in lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, and language disfluency. Using machine learning classifiers (SVM, KNN, and RF), we achieved up to 88% accuracy in distinguishing early-AD patients from normal controls, with mean length of utterance (MLU) and long pauses ratio (LPR) serving as core linguistic indicators. Moreover, the integration of linguistic indicators with biomarkers significantly improved predictive accuracy for AD. Regression analysis also highlighted crucial linguistic features, such as MLU, LPR, Type-to-Token ratio (TTR), and passive construction ratio (PCR), which were sensitive to changes in cognitive function.

Acoustic features and linguistic features are usually used in speech analysis. However, no studies have yet determined which type of features provides better screening effectiveness, especially in the large aging population of China. OBJECTIVE: Firstly, to compare the screening effectiveness of acoustic features, linguistic features, and their combination using the same dataset. Secondly, to develop Chinese automated diagnosis model using self-collected natural discourse data obtained from native Chinese speakers. METHODS: A total of 92 participants from communities in Shanghai, completed MoCA-B and a picture description task based on the Cookie Theft under the guidance of trained operators, and were divided into three groups including AD, MCI, and heathy control (HC) based on their MoCA-B score. Acoustic features (Pitches, Jitter, Shimmer, MFCCs, Formants) and linguistic features (part-of-speech, type-token ratio, information words, information units) are extracted. The machine algorithms used in this study included logistic regression, random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayesian (GNB), and k-Nearest neighbor (kNN). The validation accuracies of the same ML model using acoustic features, linguistic features, and their combination were compared. RESULTS: The accuracy with linguistic features is generally higher than acoustic features in training. The highest accuracy to differentiate HC and AD is 80.77% achieved by SVM, based on all the features extracted from the speech data, while the highest accuracy to differentiate HC and AD or MCI is 80.43% achieved by RF, based only on linguistic features.

This will enrich the Alzheimer's research community with further understanding of methods to improve models for AD classification and addressing non-stationarity and non-linearity properties on audio features to determine the best-suited acoustic features for AD monitoring.",2022,2025-02-19 20:46:19,2025-02-19 20:46:19,Unknown,901419,Unknown,Unknown,4,Unknown,Front Digit Health,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,eng,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,PubMed,Unknown,PMID: 36465088 PMCID: PMC9712439,Unknown,/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/WWCUK87I/Hason and Krishnan - 2022 - Spontaneous speech feature analysis for alzheimer's disease screening using a random forest classifi.pdf; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36465088,Unknown,acoustic features; Alzheimer's disease; classification; data augmentation; machine learning; non-linearity; non-stationarity; spontaneous speech,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

Language is proved to have the relationship with AD, so the time that AD can be diagnosed in a doctor's office is coming. METHODS: In this study, the Pitt datasets are used to detect AD which is balanced in gender and age. First bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (Bert) pretrained model is used to acquire the word vector. Then two channels are constructed in the feature extraction layer, which is, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long and short time memory (LSTM) model to extract local features and global features respectively. The local features and global features are concatenated to generate feature vectors containing rich semantics, which are sent to softmax classifier for classification. RESULTS: Finally, we obtain a best accuracy of 89.3% which is comparative compared to other studies. In the meanwhile, we do the comparative experiments with TextCNN and LSTM model respectively, the combined model manifests best and TextCNN takes the second place.

The language change in patients with AD is an important signal of their cognitive status, which potentially helps in early diagnosis. In this study, we developed a transfer learning model based on speech and natural language processing (NLP) technology for the early diagnosis of AD. The lack of large datasets limits the use of complex neural network models without feature engineering, while transfer learning can effectively solve this problem. The transfer learning model is firstly pre-trained on large text datasets to get the pre-trained language model, and then, based on such a model, an AD classification model is performed on small training sets. Concretely, a distilled bidirectional encoder representation (distilBert) embedding, combined with a logistic regression classifier, is used to distinguish AD from normal controls. The model experiment was evaluated on Alzheimer's dementia recognition through spontaneous speech datasets in 2020, including the balanced 78 healthy controls (HC) and 78 patients with AD. The accuracy of the proposed model is 0.88, which is almost equivalent to the champion score in the challenge and a considerable improvement over the baseline of 75% established by organizers of the challenge. As a result, the transfer learning method in this study improves AD prediction, which does not only reduces the need for feature engineering but also addresses the lack of sufficiently large datasets.",2022,2025-02-19 20:47:03,2025-02-19 20:47:03,Unknown,772592,Unknown,Unknown,10,Unknown,Front Public Health,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,eng,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,PubMed,Unknown,PMID: 35493375 PMCID: PMC9043451,Unknown,/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/DACEQTDI/Liu et al. - 2022 - A Transfer Learning Method for Detecting Alzheimer's Disease Based on Speech and Natural Language Pr.pdf; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35493375,Unknown,Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer's disease; BERT; Humans; machine learning; Machine Learning; natural language processing; Natural Language Processing; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Speech; transfer learning,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

The basis of any automatic SLAMs is a machine learning (ML) classifier that is trained on participants' speech and language. However, language tasks, recording media, and modalities impact the performance of ML classifiers. Thus, this research has focused on evaluating the effects of the above-mentioned factors on the performance of ML classifiers that can be used for dementia assessment. METHODOLOGY: Our methodology includes the following steps: (1) Collecting speech and language datasets from patients and healthy controls; (2) Using feature engineering methods which include feature extraction methods to extract linguistic and acoustic features and feature selection methods to select most informative features; (3) Training different ML classifiers; and (4) Evaluating the performance of ML classifiers to investigate the impacts of language tasks, recording media, and modalities on dementia assessment. RESULTS: Our results show that (1) the ML classifiers trained with the picture description language task perform better than the classifiers trained with the story recall language task; (2) the data obtained from phone-based recordings improves the performance of ML classifiers compared to data obtained from web-based recordings; and (3) the ML classifiers trained with acoustic features perform better than the classifiers trained with linguistic features.

Since AD significantly affects the content and acoustics of spontaneous speech, natural language processing, and machine learning provide promising techniques for reliably detecting AD. There has been a recent proliferation of classification models for AD, but these vary in the datasets used, model types and training and testing paradigms. In this study, we compare and contrast the performance of two common approaches for automatic AD detection from speech on the same, well-matched dataset, to determine the advantages of using domain knowledge vs. pre-trained transfer models. Methods: Audio recordings and corresponding manually-transcribed speech transcripts of a picture description task administered to 156 demographically matched older adults, 78 with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 78 cognitively intact (healthy) were classified using machine learning and natural language processing as ""AD"" or ""non-AD."" The audio was acoustically-enhanced, and post-processed to improve quality of the speech recording as well control for variation caused by recording conditions. Two approaches were used for classification of these speech samples: (1) using domain knowledge: extracting an extensive set of clinically relevant linguistic and acoustic features derived from speech and transcripts based on prior literature, and (2) using transfer-learning and leveraging large pre-trained machine learning models: using transcript-representations that are automatically derived from state-of-the-art pre-trained language models, by fine-tuning Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT)-based sequence classification models. Results: We compared the utility of speech transcript representations obtained from recent natural language processing models (i.e., BERT) to more clinically-interpretable language feature-based methods. Both the feature-based approaches and fine-tuned BERT models significantly outperformed the baseline linguistic model using a small set of linguistic features, demonstrating the importance of extensive linguistic information for detecting cognitive impairments relating to AD. We observed that fine-tuned BERT models numerically outperformed feature-based approaches on the AD detection task, but the difference was not statistically significant. Our main contribution is the observation that when tested on the same, demographically balanced dataset and tested on independent, unseen data, both domain knowledge and pretrained linguistic models have good predictive performance for detecting AD based on speech. It is notable that linguistic information alone is capable of achieving comparable, and even numerically better, performance than models including both acoustic and linguistic features here. We also try to shed light on the inner workings of the more black-box natural language processing model by performing an interpretability analysis, and find that attention weights reveal interesting patterns such as higher attribution to more important information content units in the picture description task, as well as pauses and filler words. Conclusion: This approach supports the value of well-performing machine learning and linguistically-focussed processing techniques to detect AD from speech and highlights the need to compare model performance on carefully balanced datasets, using consistent same training parameters and independent test datasets in order to determine the best performing predictive model.",2021,2025-02-25 13:43:45,2025-02-25 13:43:45,Unknown,635945,Unknown,Unknown,13,Unknown,Front Aging Neurosci,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,eng,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,PubMed,Unknown,PMID: 33986655 PMCID: PMC8110916,Unknown,/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/KKP4ZF5I/Balagopalan et al. - 2021 - Comparing Pre-trained and Feature-Based Models for Prediction of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Speech.pdf; ,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986655,Unknown,Alzheimer's disease; BERT; dementia detection; feature engineering; MMSE regression; transfer learning,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown
