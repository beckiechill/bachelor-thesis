Investigating alterations in speech and language patterns offers a promising path towards cost-effective and non-invasive early detection of AD on a large scale. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, have enabled powerful new possibilities for semantic text analysis. In this study, we leverage GPT-4 to extract five semantic features from transcripts of spontaneous patient speech. The features capture known symptoms of AD, but they are difficult to quantify effectively using traditional methods of computational linguistics. We demonstrate the clinical significance of these features and further validate one of them (“Word-Finding Difficulties”) against a proxy measure and human raters. When combined with established linguistic features and a Random Forest classifier, the GPT-derived features significantly improve the detection of AD. Our approach proves effective for both manually transcribed and automatically generated transcripts, representing a novel and impactful use of recent advancements in LLMs for AD speech analysis.","2025-01","2025-02-18 13:14:05","2025-02-18 13:14:11","2025-02-18 13:14:05","1850–1864","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computational Linguistics","Abu Dhabi, UAE","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/42EPWUCY/Heitz et al. - 2025 - Linguistic Features Extracted by GPT-4 Improve Alzheimer`s Disease Detection based on Spontaneous Sp.pdf","","","","Rambow, Owen; Wanner, Leo; Apidianaki, Marianna; Al-Khalifa, Hend; Eugenio, Barbara Di; Schockaert, Steven","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","COLING 2025","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, datasets for AD assessment are often sparse and incomplete. In this work, we leverage the multiview nature of a small AD dataset, DementiaBank, to learn an embedding that captures different modes of cognitive impairment. We apply generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) to our dataset and demonstrate the added benefit of using multiview embeddings in two downstream tasks: identifying AD and predicting clinical scores. By including multiview embeddings, we obtain an F1 score of 0.82 in the classification task and a mean absolute error of 3.42 in the regression task. Furthermore, we show that multiview embeddings can be obtained from other datasets as well.","2018-10","2025-02-18 13:18:15","2025-02-18 13:18:15","2025-02-18 13:18:15","2812–2817","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computational Linguistics","Brussels, Belgium","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/PNS8Q5EG/Pou-Prom and Rudzicz - 2018 - Learning multiview embeddings for assessing dementia.pdf","","","","Riloff, Ellen; Chiang, David; Hockenmaier, Julia; Tsujii, Jun'ichi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EMNLP 2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research has shown that alterations in speech, as well as linguistic and semantic deviations in spontaneous conversation detected using natural language processing, manifest early in AD prior to some other observed cognitive deficits. Recent studies show that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels serve as useful early biomarkers for identifying early AD, but CSF biomarkers are challenging to collect. A simpler alternative that has seen very rapid development is based on the use of plasma biomarkers as a blood draw is minimally invasive. Associating verbal and nonverbal characteristics from speech data with CSF and plasma biomarkers may open the door to less invasive, more efficient methods for early AD detection. We present SLaCAD, a new dataset to facilitate this process. We describe our data collection procedures, analyze the resulting corpus, and present preliminary findings that relate measures extracted from the audio and transcribed text to clinical diagnoses, CSF levels, and plasma biomarkers. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of this and indicate that the collected data can be used to improve assessments of early AD.","2024-05","2025-02-18 13:29:28","2025-02-18 13:29:28","2025-02-18 13:29:28","14877–14897","","","","","","SLaCAD","","","","","ELRA and ICCL","Torino, Italia","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/MYZIG6JV/Farzana et al. - 2024 - SLaCAD A Spoken Language Corpus for Early Alzheimer`s Disease Detection.pdf","","","","Calzolari, Nicoletta; Kan, Min-Yen; Hoste, Veronique; Lenci, Alessandro; Sakti, Sakriani; Xue, Nianwen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LREC-COLING 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study of changes in speech offers a potential means for large-scale AD screening that is non-invasive and inexpensive. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is necessary for a fully automated system. We compare different ASR systems in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) using a publicly available benchmark dataset of speech recordings of AD patients and controls. Furthermore, this study is the first to quantify how popular linguistic features change when replacing manual transcriptions with ASR output. This contributes to the understanding of linguistic features in the context of AD detection. Moreover, we investigate how ASR affects AD classification performance by implementing two popular approaches: A fine-tuned BERT model, and Random Forest on popular linguistic features. Our results show best classification performance when using manual transcripts, but the degradation when using ASR is not dramatic. Performance stays strong, achieving an AUROC of 0.87. Our BERT-based approach is affected more strongly by ASR transcription errors than the simpler and more explainable approach based on linguistic features.","2024-05","2025-02-18 13:37:34","2025-02-18 13:37:34","2025-02-18 13:37:34","15955–15969","","","","","","","","","","","ELRA and ICCL","Torino, Italia","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/89BVEASR/Heitz et al. - 2024 - The Influence of Automatic Speech Recognition on Linguistic Features and Automatic Alzheimer`s Disea.pdf","","","","Calzolari, Nicoletta; Kan, Min-Yen; Hoste, Veronique; Lenci, Alessandro; Sakti, Sakriani; Xue, Nianwen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","LREC-COLING 2024","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, questions remain about their ability to generalize beyond the small reference sets that are publicly available for research. As an alternative to fitting model parameters directly, we propose a novel method by which a Transformer DL model (GPT-2) pre-trained on general English text is paired with an artificially degraded version of itself (GPT-D), to compute the ratio between these two models' perplexities on language from cognitively healthy and impaired individuals. This technique approaches state-of-the-art performance on text data from a widely used “Cookie Theft” picture description task, and unlike established alternatives also generalizes well to spontaneous conversations. Furthermore, GPT-D generates text with characteristics known to be associated with AD, demonstrating the induction of dementia-related linguistic anomalies. Our study is a step toward better understanding of the relationships between the inner workings of generative neural language models, the language that they produce, and the deleterious effects of dementia on human speech and language characteristics.","2022-05","2025-02-18 13:41:55","2025-02-18 13:41:55","2025-02-18 13:41:55","1866–1877","","","","","","GPT-D","","","","","Association for Computational Linguistics","Dublin, Ireland","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/DZ8EPIIC/Li et al. - 2022 - GPT-D Inducing Dementia-related Linguistic Anomalies by Deliberate Degradation of Artificial Neural.pdf","","","","Muresan, Smaranda; Nakov, Preslav; Villavicencio, Aline","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACL 2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To improve detection accuracies, increasing the amount of data or the number of linguistic features have been two applicable approaches. However, acquiring additional clinical data can be expensive, and hand-crafting features is burdensome. In this paper, we take a third approach, proposing Consensus Networks (CNs), a framework to classify after reaching agreements between modalities. We divide linguistic features into non-overlapping subsets according to their modalities, and let neural networks learn low-dimensional representations that agree with each other. These representations are passed into a classifier network. All neural networks are optimized iteratively. In this paper, we also present two methods that improve the performance of CNs. We then present ablation studies to illustrate the effectiveness of modality division. To understand further what happens in CNs, we visualize the representations during training. Overall, using all of the 413 linguistic features, our models significantly outperform traditional classifiers, which are used by the state-of-the-art papers.","2019-06","2025-02-18 19:47:44","2025-02-18 19:47:44","2025-02-18 19:47:44","1431–1441","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computational Linguistics","Minneapolis, Minnesota","","","","","","ACLWeb","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/79IJDPBU/Zhu et al. - 2019 - Detecting cognitive impairments by agreeing on interpretations of linguistic features.pdf","","","","Burstein, Jill; Doran, Christy; Solorio, Thamar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","NAACL-HLT 2019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
