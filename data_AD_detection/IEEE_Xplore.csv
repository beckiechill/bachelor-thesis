While previous studies have employed acoustic (speech) features for characterisation of Alzheimer's dementia, these studies focused on a few common prosodic features, often in combination with lexical and syntactic features which require transcription. We present a detailed study of the predictive value of purely acoustic features automatically extracted from spontaneous speech for Alzheimer's dementia detection, from a computational paralinguistics perspective. The effectiveness of several state-of-the-art paralinguistic feature sets for Alzheimer's detection were assessed on a balanced sample of DementiaBank's Pitt spontaneous speech dataset, with patients matched by gender and age. The feature sets assessed were the extended Geneva minimalistic acoustic parameter set (eGeMAPS), the emobase feature set, the ComParE 2013 feature set, and new Multi-Resolution Cochleagram (MRCG) features. Furthermore, we introduce a new active data representation (ADR) method for feature extraction in Alzheimer's dementia recognition. Results show that classification models based solely on acoustic speech features extracted through our ADR method can achieve accuracy levels comparable to those achieved by models that employ higher-level language features. Analysis of the results suggests that all feature sets contribute information not captured by other feature sets. We show that while the eGeMAPS feature set provides slightly better accuracy than other feature sets individually (71.34%), “hard fusion” of feature sets improves accuracy to 78.70%.","2020-02","2025-02-19 09:11:10","2025-02-19 09:11:10","2025-02-19 09:11:10","272-281","","2","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/U5SD7B7H/Haider et al. - 2020 - An Assessment of Paralinguistic Acoustic Features for Detection of Alzheimer's Dementia in Spontaneo.pdf","","","Acoustics; Affective computing; Alzheimer; Alzheimer's disease; cognitive decline detection; cognitive imp-airment detection; dementia; Feature extraction; Semantics; social signal processing; Task analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The World Health Organisation reports an alarming 55 million individuals living with dementia worldwide, with an additional 10 million new cases identified annually. Dementia, a group of cognitive disorders affecting fundamental abilities like thinking, remembering, and reasoning, is primarily attributed to the destruction of brain cells, exerting a profound impact on brain function. Alzheimer’s disease, representing 60-80 percent of all dementia cases, is a progressive neurological condition, while vascular dementia, the second most prevalent form, results from microscopic brain hemorrhages and artery blockages. The progression of Alzheimer’s disease disrupts memory and cognitive functions. This study aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse by comparing the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in forecasting dementia incidence over two years against established models. The objective is to identify the most effective analytical techniques and determine the optimal number of predictive components for such forecasts. It is noteworthy that dementia-like symptoms may arise from treatable conditions, such as thyroid issues and vitamin shortages, underscoring the critical importance of early diagnosis and intervention. The significant challenges posed by dementia, particularly for elderly individuals struggling to manage their emotions, highlight the urgency for effective treatments. In this investigation, the accuracy of various machine-learning methods is assessed using a Kaggle dataset dedicated to dementia research. This analysis aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts aimed at enhancing dementia prediction and early diagnosis. The ultimate goal is to improve the well-being of individuals grappling with this debilitating affliction. The study reveals promising accuracy levels with Random Forest, GaussianNb, SVM, and AdaBoost, all demonstrating a high accuracy of 0.99, reinforcing the potential of machine learning in advancing our understanding and management of dementia.","2024-04","2025-02-24 13:03:09","2025-02-24 13:03:09","2025-02-24 13:03:09","382-386","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/HYQ5EWVH/M M et al. - 2024 - Detection of Dementia using Machine Learning Algorithms.pdf; /Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/3MKAIJ8B/10534009.html","","","Alzheimer’s detection; Alzheimer's disease; Feature Extraction; Machine Learning; Machine learning algorithms; Microscopy; Object recognition; Older adults; Predictive models; Support vector machines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 International Conference on Cognitive Robotics and Intelligent Systems (ICC - ROBINS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also the main cause of dementia, which affects memory, thinking skills, and mental abilities. Nowadays, researchers have moved their interest towards AD detection from spontaneous speech, since it constitutes a time-effective procedure. However, existing state-of-the-art works proposing multimodal approaches do not take into consideration the inter- and intra-modal interactions and propose early and late fusion approaches. To tackle these limitations, we propose deep neural networks, which can be trained in an end-to-end trainable way and capture the inter- and intra-modal interactions. Firstly, each audio file is converted to an image consisting of three channels, i.e., log-Mel spectrogram, delta, and delta-delta. Next, each transcript is passed through a BERT model followed by a gated self-attention layer. Similarly, each image is passed through a Swin Transformer followed by an independent gated self-attention layer. Acoustic features are extracted also from each audio file. Finally, the representation vectors from the different modalities are fed to a tensor fusion layer for capturing the inter-modal interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on the ADReSS Challenge dataset indicate that our introduced approaches obtain valuable advantages over existing research initiatives reaching Accuracy and F1-score up to 86.25% and 85.48% respectively.","2022-09","2025-02-24 13:04:05","2025-02-24 13:04:05","2025-02-24 13:04:05","1-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2641-3604","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/VDEI7T8Z/Ilias et al. - 2022 - A Multimodal Approach for Dementia Detection from Spontaneous Speech with Tensor Fusion Layer.pdf; /Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/DEAYZVMA/9926818.html","","","Alzheimer's Disease; BERT; Deep learning; Dementia; Feature extraction; Gated Self-Attention; log-Mel spectrogram; Logic gates; Neural networks; Neurological diseases; Swin Transformer; Tensor Fusion Layer; Tensors; Transformers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022 IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Language deficit is one of the common signs that appear in the early stage of mild Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, using natural language processing and related machine learning algorithms for AD diagnosis using patients’ speech recordings has drawn more attention in recent years. In this study, three approaches are proposed to extract features through speech recording in this model: (1) using fine-tuning pre-trained encoder model (BERT) for transcripts from automatic transcription, (2) hand-crafted linguistic features for transcripts from automatic transcription, and (3) selected acoustic features for denoised speech recordings. The three designed approaches are applied to three tasks: AD diagnosis, MMSE score prediction, and cognitive decline inference. The approach using BERT yields the best performance in all three challenge tasks based on cross-validation results using the training dataset. Specifically, in the AD diagnosis task, 5-fold cross-validation using encoded features based on transcripts generated from Deep Speech yields an average classification accuracy of 97.18%. In the MMSE score prediction task, 5-fold cross-validation using BERT encoded features based on transcripts generated from Deep Speech yields an average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 3.76. In the cognitive decline inference task, the leave-one-out cross-validation using BERT encoded features based on transcripts generated from Sphinx or Deep Speech yields an average classification accuracy of 100%. The analyses suggest that the combination of automatic transcription and BERT may produce a significant performance in AD related detection and prediction problems.","2021-09","2025-02-24 13:04:07","2025-02-24 13:04:07","2025-02-24 13:04:07","39-43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2642-6471","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/KIN9LR4J/Liu et al. - 2021 - Automatic Diagnosis and Prediction of Cognitive Decline Associated with Alzheimer’s Dementia through.pdf; /Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/799JR92T/9576784.html","","","Alzheimer’s dementia; automatic speech recognition; Bit error rate; detection; Feature extraction; Linguistics; Machine learning algorithms; Natural language processing; prediction; Reliability; Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications (ICSIPA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study aims to establish state-of-the-art performance in the automatic identification of different dementia etiologies, including AD, MCI, and Possible AD (PoAD), and to determine whether patients with initial cognitive declines exhibit language deficits through the analysis of language samples deduced with the cookie theft picture description task. Data was derived from the cookie theft picture corpus of DementiaBank, from which all language samples of the identified etiologies were used, with a random subsampling technique that handles the skewness of the classes. Several original lexical and syntactic (i.e., lexicosyntactic) features were introduced and used alongside previously established lexicosyntactics to train machine learning (ML) classifiers against these etiologies. Further, a statistical analysis was conducted to uncover the deficiency across these etiologies. Our models resulted in benchmarks for differentiating all the identified classes with accuracies ranging between 95 to 98% and corresponding F1 values falling between 94 and 98%. The statistical analysis of our lexicosyntactic biomarkers shows that linguistic deviations are associated with prodromal as well as advanced neurodegenerative pathologies, being greatly impacted as cognitive decline increases and suggesting that language biomarkers may aid the early diagnosis of these pathologies.","2020","2025-02-24 13:04:10","2025-02-24 13:04:10","2025-02-24 13:04:10","193856-193873","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/6XLIJ7ZS/Alkenani et al. - 2020 - Predicting Prodromal Dementia Using Linguistic Patterns and Deficits.pdf; /Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/QARN7S2W/9218925.html","","","Acoustics; Alzheimer’s disease; clinical diagnosis; cognitive decline; Dementia; Feature extraction; feature selection; Linguistics; machine learning; neurolinguistics; prediction; prodromal dementia; Support vector machines; Syntactics; Task analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most of them simply take the speech data from a subject participating in a task (e.g., picture description) as a whole audio sequence, and lack considerations on separate utterances that may be related to different topics in the picture and are of different importance for discriminating AD patients from healthy controls. To this end, this letter proposes an AD detection method with topic modeling for utterances composed of audio words. First, an audio word discovery algorithm using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is designed to tokenize speech data without relying on text transcriptions. Then, a topic model is built that assigns each utterance a topic label in an unsupervised way. Finally, an Audio-Word HuBERT (AW-HuBERT) model integrating utterance-level topic labels is constructed for AD detection. This model is pretrained by training the existing HuBERT model with audio word sequences. The final decision for a recording is made by the weighted sum of utterance-level classification possibilities, and topic-dependent Area-Under-Curve (AUC) values are used as the weights. Experimental results on the DementiaBank dataset show that the proposed method achieves a better AD detection accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.","2023","2025-02-24 13:05:42","2025-02-24 13:05:42","2025-02-24 13:05:42","1727-1731","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Signal Processing Letters","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/T4FFYD64/Guo and Ling - 2023 - Exploring the Topics of Audio Words for Detecting Alzheimer's Disease From Spontaneous Speech.pdf; /Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/AFTVRFDQ/10323509.html","","","Alzheimer's disease; Data models; deep learning; Feature extraction; natural language processing; Signal processing algorithms; Speech coding; Speech processing; Task analysis; Training data; Vocabulary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, demographic information of the participants was integrated to enhance the models’ predictive accuracy. Our methodology involved processing each dataset version through a series of machine learning models tailored to each task, starting with a baseline version, followed by hyperparameter optimisation, and finally applying a combination of preprocessing steps (scaling, outlier removal, dimensionality reduction, and skewness correction) to identify the optimal setup for each model.The findings indicate that preprocessing steps significantly improve model performance across all tasks, underscoring the importance of data preparation in machine learning workflows for healthcare applications. Notably, the use of acoustic data alone for AD detection shows promising results, suggesting a pathway toward more generalised approaches that could incorporate recordings in various languages without linguistic dependency. This opens up the possibility for scalable, non-invasive screening tools for AD, leveraging the universal nature of acoustic markers in speech for early detection and monitoring of this condition.","2024-08","2025-02-24 13:05:46","2025-02-24 13:05:46","2025-02-24 13:05:46","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/PLVFANRK/Sviderski et al. - 2024 - Multi-Task Learning with Acoustic Features for Alzheimer’s Disease Detection.pdf; /Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/C7L9CM6U/10718774.html","","","acoustic analysis; Acoustics; Alzheimer’s dementia; Alzheimer's disease; Data models; feature engineering; Feature extraction; machine learning; Monitoring; Multitasking; Optimization; Predictive models; Recording; Regression analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2024 29th International Conference on Automation and Computing (ICAC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a slow progressive disease affecting the brain cells. This affects the cognitive abilities of people and their daily activities. During the course of the disease, memory gets brutally affected too. Working as well as long-term declarative memory deteriorates in AD patients. Due to this deterioration of the memory, AD patients tend to show a decline in their communicative skills as well. This decline is reflected in their speech. AD patients usually have poor grammar along with very low coherent ideas. Also, they tend to repeat the words very often and hence become unclear on the message they are trying to convey. As the disease progresses, the speech is completely impaired, and the patients are left to sing or utter words that are totally out of context. Stopwords are the words that are most commonly used in language and it is often hypothesized that AD patients use them much often as compared to Control Normal (CN) subjects. It is seen that due to the degeneration of brain cells in AD patients, they have a tendency to use a lot of stopwords to fill their perplexities in their statements. In this paper, the usefulness of the stopwords in capturing the linguistic information of the patients suffering from AD are discussed. Learning algorithms are evaluated by including stopwords and dropping stopwords at preprocessing to draw comparisons.","2021-07","2025-02-24 13:05:49","2025-02-24 13:05:49","2025-02-24 13:05:49","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2161-4407","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/Q6H3P72P/Adhikari et al. - 2021 - A Comparative Study of Machine Learning and NLP Techniques for Uses of Stop Words by Patients in Dia.pdf; /Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/SGL2DDIS/9534449.html","","","Alzheimer's Disease; Analytical models; Brain cells; Data Preprocessing; Feature Extraction; Linguistics; Natural Language Processing; Predictive models; Senior citizens; Speech analysis; Speech synthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study addresses this by employing speech analysis for AD detection, offering a non-invasive and cost-effective diagnostic tool. Utilizing the ADReSS dataset, we integrated advanced Deep Learning techniques, including YAMNet and VGGish, with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for feature extraction. An autoencoder was employed for dimensionality reduction to isolate key speech features. We applied Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification. The ANN model outperformed others, achieving an impressive 89.3 % accuracy, surpassing current methodologies. This research highlights the efficacy of using speech analysis and ML, DL for early AD detection. Our approach, accessible and precise, promises advancements in early diagnosis and care for AD.

Recent deep learning models have exploited speech pauses to achieve highly accurate dementia detection, but have not exploited the interpretability of speech pauses, i.e., what and how positions and lengths of speech pauses affect the result of dementia detection. In this paper, we will study the positions and lengths of dementia-sensitive pauses using adversarial learning approaches. Specifically, we first utilize an adversarial attack approach by adding the perturbation to the speech pauses of the testing samples, aiming to reduce the confidence levels of the detection model. Then, we apply an adversarial training approach to evaluate the impact of the perturbation in training samples on the detection model. We examine the interpretability from the perspectives of model accuracy, pause context, and pause length. We found that some pauses are more sensitive to dementia than other pauses from the model’s perspective, e.g., speech pauses near to the verb “is”. Increasing lengths of sensitive pauses or adding sensitive pauses leads the model inference to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), while decreasing the lengths of sensitive pauses or deleting sensitive pauses leads to non-AD.","2022-05","2025-02-24 13:07:05","2025-02-24 13:07:05","2025-02-24 13:07:05","6462-6466","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2379-190X","","/Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/T24SSXBD/Zhu et al. - 2022 - Towards Interpretability of Speech Pause in Dementia Detection Using Adversarial Learning.pdf; /Users/rebecasanz/Zotero/storage/YVWCI6EV/9747006.html","","","acoustic feature; Adversarial machine learning; Deep learning; dementia detection; Feature extraction; interpretability; Perturbation methods; Speech pauses; Speech processing; Speech recognition; spontaneous speech; Training","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ICASSP 2022 - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
